The amyloid protein was characterized in 7 cases by immunohistochemistry. Among the bladder and ureter amyloidosis, 2 cases were classified as AL lambda amyloidosis and one case as AA amyloidosis in a patient with long history of chronic arthritis. In the fourth case, the deposits could not be identified. Nevertheless an AL amyloidosis might be suggested. Two cases of prostate and/or seminal vesicles amyloidosis were stained with an anti-B2M antibody, in hemodialyzed patients. The 2 others, positive with the anti-Transthyretina antibody, were classified as senile amyloidosis. This small series illustrated the heterogeneous pathogenic types of amyloidosis in the urogenital tract and emphasized the interest of immunohistochemistry to identify the chemical composition of these deposits.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Our objective was to investigate the prognostic significance of serum beta-2 microglobulin (B2M) levels among patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). All patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive early chronic phase CML (i.e., within 1 year of diagnosis) treated with IFN alpha-based therapy at the M. D. Anderson Cancer Center between 1980 and 1997, in whom pretreatment B2M levels were available, were investigated. Two hundred one patients were evaluable. Their median B2M was 2.2 mg/dl (range, 1.1-20 mg/dl). Serum B2M levels were associated with other variables of prognostic significance, including age, spleen size, WBC count, percentage of peripheral and marrow blasts, and percentage of marrow basophils. Patients with B2M levels &gt;2.9 mg/dl (ie., the upper quartile of the distribution) had a significantly lower rate of major cytogenetic response compared to those in the lower three quartiles (20 versus 52%; P &lt; 0.01). They also had a shorter survival, with a 5-year survival rate of 48%, compared with 75% for those in the lower quartiles (P = 0.01). High B2M levels (&gt;2.9 mg/dl) could identify a group of patients with an adverse outcome within patients in stage I disease (P = 0.02). Results for patients in stages 2-4 were inconclusive because of the small number of patients in these groups. We conclude that serum B2M levels are an important, and probably independent, prognostic factor for patients with CML in early chronic phase treated with IFN-based therapy.</td>\n",

Epidemiological studies have found a possible correlation between increased cancer incidence and environmental ELF EMF exposures. Results from in vitro studies performed to examine the possible underlying bioeffects of ELF EMFs have varied greatly. Reported effects range from robust and reproducible effects to undetectable. In this study, Daudi cells were exposed to 60 Hz magnetic fields for 20, 40 or 60 min at flux densities of 12.5, 50, 100 or 500 microT. Exposures were performed in the Regional ELF-EMF Exposure Facility (Rockville, MD) to minimize variables that might contribute to a false positive effect. Exposures included sham/sham, exposed/sham or sham/exposed, and were performed with blinding with respect to type of exposure. 12-O-Tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) treatment was used as a positive control. Total cellular RNA was isolated using a single-step technique. Human MYC expression was measured by northern blot hybridization as an indicator of the responsiveness of Daudi cells to experimental conditions. Beta-2-microglobulin (B2M) expression was measured simultaneously as an internal control. Exposure to a 60 Hz magnetic field did not significantly alter MYC expression in Daudi cells under any of the exposure conditions.</td>\n",

We studied two different types of low-flux membranes at reuses 0, 6, and 12 in five patients undergoing hemodialysis with the following combinations of membrane and sterilant: cellulose diacetate membrane and formaldehyde, polysulfone membrane and formaldehyde, cellulose diacetate membrane and peracetic acid, and polysulfone and peracetic acid. The permeability of the membranes was assessed through the hydraulic ultrafiltration coefficient (K(UF)), sieving coefficient for beta(2)-microglobulin (B2M), and vitamin B(12) and albumin concentrations in ultrafiltrate. After 12 reuses, total cell volume (TCV) tended to be reduced in both cellulose diacetate and polysulfone dialyzers irrespective of the sterilant used, but significance was only found for the first set of dialyzers. Cellulose diacetate dialyzers reprocessed with either formaldehyde or peracetic acid showed an important reduction in K(UF) (31% [P &lt; 0.05] and 23% [P &lt; 0.05], respectively). A significant elevation in K(UF) was found in polysulfone membranes reprocessed with peracetic acid (41%; P &lt; 0.05), but no alterations in K(UF) were found in polysulfone membranes reprocessed with formaldehyde. Cellulose diacetate membranes were intrinsically more permeable to B2M than polysulfone membranes (sieving coefficient, 6. 85 +/- 2.53 versus 0.04 +/- 0.02 x 10(-2); P &lt; 0.001), which was not modified by any of the sterilants. Vitamin B(12) levels in ultrafiltrate decreased to an undetectable level in four of five samples collected after 12 reuses in polysulfone membranes reprocessed with peracetic acid (90 +/- 71 to 3 +/- 8 pg/mL; P &lt; 0. 05 versus reuse 0). Albumin leakage occurred in two of five samples after the 12th reuse, but only in polysulfone membranes reprocessed with peracetic acid. Our findings suggest that reuse of low-flux polysulfone dialyzers reprocessed with peracetic acid is associated with structural damage of the membrane and a reduced permeability to middle molecules.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Acute kidney injury (AKI) has a significant impact on the short-term and long-term clinical outcomes of pediatric and neonatal patients, and it is imperative in these populations to mitigate the pathways leading to AKI and be prepared for early diagnosis and treatment intervention of established AKI. Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) has provided more advent predictive models for early detection/prediction of AKI utilizing machine learning (ML). By providing strong detail and evidence from risk scores and electronic alerts, this review outlines a comprehensive and holistic insight into the current state of AI in AKI in pediatric/neonatal patients. In the pediatric population, AI models including XGBoost, logistic regression, support vector machines, decision trees, naïve Bayes, and risk stratification scores (Renal Angina Index (RAI), Nephrotoxic Injury Negated by Just-in-time Action (NINJA)) have shown success in predicting AKI using variables like serum creatinine, urine output, and electronic health record (EHR) alerts. Similarly, in the neonatal population, using the \"Baby NINJA\" model showed a decrease in nephrotoxic medication exposure by 42%, the rate of AKI by 78%, and the number of days with AKI by 68%. Furthermore, the \"STARZ\" risk stratification AI model showed a predictive ability of AKI within 7 days of NICU admission of AUC 0.93 and AUC of 0.96 in the validation and derivation cohorts, respectively. Many studies have reported the superiority of using biomarkers to predict AKI in pediatric patients and neonates as well. Future directions include the application of AI along with biomarkers (NGAL, CysC, OPN, IL-18, B2M, etc.) in a Labelbox configuration to create a more robust and accurate model for predicting and detecting pediatric/neonatal AKI.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Selection of stable housekeeping genes (HKGs) is very important for accurate calculation of relative expression levels of target genes by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). At present, the appropriate HKGs have not been identified in placental tissues throughout the pregnancy of the goat. In our study, 20 HKGs were tentatively selected from RNA-seq data and previous reports. The cycle threshold (Ct) of HKGs was determined by qRT-PCR in trophoblast membrane and cotyledon villus collected from 38 Dazu Black goats on gestation days of 20, 25, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, and 150 (birth). The expression stability of the HKGs was analyzed by geNorm, Normfinder, Bestkeeper and Delta Ct algorithms, and comprehensively evaluated by ReFinder and ComprFinder. In addition, the optimal HKGs were further verified by placenta-specific genes (SPP1, VEGFA and PAG6). The 16 candidate HKGs (except POP4, TBP, RNF10, UBC) showed a qualified Ct value, less than 28. Among them, YWHAZ, EIF3K and PPIB showed the most stable expression in placental tissues during early, mid-late pregnancy and postpartum, but the least stable expression was B2M at early and mid-late stage, and PPIB at postpartum. After comprehensive analysis, RPLP0, EIF3K and YWHAZ were found to be the most stable placental HKGs throughout pregnancy. The classical HKGs, ACTB, GAPDH and 18S RNA have unstable expressions and even ranked at the bottom of the list from comprehensive index, suggesting an inappropriate for target gene normalization. Taken together, our study confirmed that YWHAZ, EIF3K, HMBS and RPLP0 may be the optimal HKGs in goat placenta at different stage of pregnancy, which provided a valuable reference of HKGs on functional gene expression detection for further research on placenta development and growth in ruminants.</td>\n",

Phlegm-blood stasis syndrome, one of the Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) syndrome differentiation, is the core pathogenesis dynamically throughout the occurrence, development, and prognosis of HF. Biomarkers having high sensitivity and specificity are highly demanded to facilitate the accurate differentiation of HF patients with phlegm-blood stasis syndrome. In the present study, serum samples were collected from 20 healthy controls and 40 HF patients (20 with and 20 without phlegm-blood stasis syndrome). We implemented data-independent acquisition mass spectrometry (DIA-MS) for discovery and parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) for validation of biomarkers for heart failure with phlegm-blood stasis syndrome. A total of 84 different proteins were found in the HF with phlegm-blood stasis syndrome (HF-TY) group compared with healthy controls. 37 candidate proteins were selected for the PRM assay, and five validated proteins with high sensitivity and specificity, including insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 4 (IGFBP4), β-2-microglobulin (B2M), dystroglycan (DAG1), immunoglobulin J chain (JCHAIN), and kallikrein B1 (KLKB1), were considered potential biomarkers for heart failure patients with phlegm-blood stasis syndrome.

Due to their desirable properties, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have recently emerged as highly promising therapeutic agents, which properties include differentiation abilit and cytokine production. While CRISPR-Cas9 technology is applied to develop MSC-based therapeutics, MSCs exhibit inefficient genome editing, and susceptibility to plasmid DNA. In this study, we compared and optimized plasmid DNA and RNP approaches for efficient genome engineering in MSCs. The RNP-mediated approach enabled genome editing with high indel frequency and low cytotoxicity in MSCs. By utilizing Cas9 RNPs, we successfully generated B2M-knockout MSCs, which reduced T-cell differentiation, and improved MSC survival. Furthermore, this approach enhanced the immunomodulatory effect of IFN-r priming. These findings indicate that the RNP-mediated engineering of MSC genomes can achieve high efficiency, and engineered MSCs offer potential as a promising therapeutic strategy.</td>\n",

In this study, we conducted a thorough analysis of 18 candidate RGs (ACTB, BACH1, B2M, GAPDH, HMBS, HPRT1, PGK1, PPIA, PPIB, RPLP0, RPL19, RPS9, RPS15, RPS28, SDHA, TBP, UXT, and YWHAZ) across 10 ovine tissues (muscle, skin, kidney, liver, intestine, rumen, lung, testis, heart, and spleen) obtained from five individual sheep. We aimed to identify genes with stable expression across these tissues. A literature-based survey helped us shortlist candidate genes representing various functional classes from multiple livestock species. We employed four algorithms: geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, and Delta Ct (ΔCt), to rank these genes based on their stability. A consistent trend in the rankings was observed across these different algorithms. RefFinder was then used for a comprehensive ranking, integrating the outputs from the various methods. ACTB, PPIB, BACH1, and B2M emerged as the most stable RGs, while RPS9, RPS15, and PGK1 displayed variable expression. We validated our findings through qPCR analysis of four target genes (ACTN2, CRYAB, DLK1, and TRIM54) in the skin samples from two different sheep breeds. Based on these results, we recommend ACTB, PPIB, BACH1, and B2M as reliable internal control genes for qPCR experiments involving diverse ovine tissues.</td>\n",

We report 8 cases, often misdiagnosed as a neoplastic process (6/8). Amyloidosis was localized in the bladder (3 cases), in the ureter (1 case) and in the prostate and/or seminal vesicles (4 cases). The amyloid protein was characterized in 7 cases by immunohistochemistry. Among the bladder and ureter amyloidosis, 2 cases were classified as AL lambda amyloidosis and one case as AA amyloidosis in a patient with long history of chronic arthritis. In the fourth case, the deposits could not be identified. Nevertheless an AL amyloidosis might be suggested. Two cases of prostate and/or seminal vesicles amyloidosis were stained with an anti-B2M antibody, in hemodialyzed patients. The 2 others, positive with the anti-Transthyretina antibody, were classified as senile amyloidosis. This small series illustrated the heterogeneous pathogenic types of amyloidosis in the urogenital tract and emphasized the interest of immunohistochemistry to identify the chemical composition of these deposits.   \n",

All patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive early chronic phase CML (i.e., within 1 year of diagnosis) treated with IFN alpha-based therapy at the M. D. Anderson Cancer Center between 1980 and 1997, in whom pretreatment B2M levels were available, were investigated. Two hundred one patients were evaluable. Their median B2M was 2.2 mg/dl (range, 1.1-20 mg/dl). Serum B2M levels were associated with other variables of prognostic significance, including age, spleen size, WBC count, percentage of peripheral and marrow blasts, and percentage of marrow basophils. Patients with B2M levels >2.9 mg/dl (ie., the upper quartile of the distribution) had a significantly lower rate of major cytogenetic response compared to those in the lower three quartiles (20 versus 52%; P < 0.01). They also had a shorter survival, with a 5-year survival rate of 48%, compared with 75% for those in the lower quartiles (P = 0.01). High B2M levels (>2.9 mg/dl) could identify a group of patients with an adverse outcome within patients in stage I disease (P = 0.02). Results for patients in stages 2-4 were inconclusive because of the small number of patients in these groups. We conclude that serum B2M levels are an important, and probably independent, prognostic factor for patients with CML in early chronic phase treated with IFN-based therapy.   \n",

Epidemiological studies have found a possible correlation between increased cancer incidence and environmental ELF EMF exposures. Results from in vitro studies performed to examine the possible underlying bioeffects of ELF EMFs have varied greatly. Reported effects range from robust and reproducible effects to undetectable. In this study, Daudi cells were exposed to 60 Hz magnetic fields for 20, 40 or 60 min at flux densities of 12.5, 50, 100 or 500 microT. Exposures were performed in the Regional ELF-EMF Exposure Facility (Rockville, MD) to minimize variables that might contribute to a false positive effect. Exposures included sham/sham, exposed/sham or sham/exposed, and were performed with blinding with respect to type of exposure. 12-O-Tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) treatment was used as a positive control. Total cellular RNA was isolated using a single-step technique. Human MYC expression was measured by northern blot hybridization as an indicator of the responsiveness of Daudi cells to experimental conditions. Beta-2-microglobulin (B2M) expression was measured simultaneously as an internal control. Exposure to a 60 Hz magnetic field did not significantly alter MYC expression in Daudi cells under any of the exposure conditions.   \n",
       "4    Little attention has been given to the effects of reuse on the permeability of low-flux membranes, especially regarding middle molecules. We studied two different types of low-flux membranes at reuses 0, 6, and 12 in five patients undergoing hemodialysis with the following combinations of membrane and sterilant: cellulose diacetate membrane and formaldehyde, polysulfone membrane and formaldehyde, cellulose diacetate membrane and peracetic acid, and polysulfone and peracetic acid. The permeability of the membranes was assessed through the hydraulic ultrafiltration coefficient (K(UF)), sieving coefficient for beta(2)-microglobulin (B2M), and vitamin B(12) and albumin concentrations in ultrafiltrate. After 12 reuses, total cell volume (TCV) tended to be reduced in both cellulose diacetate and polysulfone dialyzers irrespective of the sterilant used, but significance was only found for the first set of dialyzers. Cellulose diacetate dialyzers reprocessed with either formaldehyde or peracetic acid showed an important reduction in K(UF) (31% [P < 0.05] and 23% [P < 0.05], respectively). A significant elevation in K(UF) was found in polysulfone membranes reprocessed with peracetic acid (41%; P < 0.05), but no alterations in K(UF) were found in polysulfone membranes reprocessed with formaldehyde. Cellulose diacetate membranes were intrinsically more permeable to B2M than polysulfone membranes (sieving coefficient, 6. 85 +/- 2.53 versus 0.04 +/- 0.02 x 10(-2); P < 0.001), which was not modified by any of the sterilants. Vitamin B(12) levels in ultrafiltrate decreased to an undetectable level in four of five samples collected after 12 reuses in polysulfone membranes reprocessed with peracetic acid (90 +/- 71 to 3 +/- 8 pg/mL; P < 0. 05 versus reuse 0). Albumin leakage occurred in two of five samples after the 12th reuse, but only in polysulfone membranes reprocessed with peracetic acid. Our findings suggest that reuse of low-flux polysulfone dialyzers reprocessed with peracetic acid is associated with structural damage of the membrane and a reduced permeability to middle molecules.   \n",

Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) has provided more advent predictive models for early detection/prediction of AKI utilizing machine learning (ML). By providing strong detail and evidence from risk scores and electronic alerts, this review outlines a comprehensive and holistic insight into the current state of AI in AKI in pediatric/neonatal patients. In the pediatric population, AI models including XGBoost, logistic regression, support vector machines, decision trees, naïve Bayes, and risk stratification scores (Renal Angina Index (RAI), Nephrotoxic Injury Negated by Just-in-time Action (NINJA)) have shown success in predicting AKI using variables like serum creatinine, urine output, and electronic health record (EHR) alerts. Similarly, in the neonatal population, using the \"Baby NINJA\" model showed a decrease in nephrotoxic medication exposure by 42%, the rate of AKI by 78%, and the number of days with AKI by 68%. Furthermore, the \"STARZ\" risk stratification AI model showed a predictive ability of AKI within 7 days of NICU admission of AUC 0.93 and AUC of 0.96 in the validation and derivation cohorts, respectively. Many studies have reported the superiority of using biomarkers to predict AKI in pediatric patients and neonates as well. Future directions include the application of AI along with biomarkers (NGAL, CysC, OPN, IL-18, B2M, etc.) in a Labelbox configuration to create a more robust and accurate model for predicting and detecting pediatric/neonatal AKI.   \n",

At present, the appropriate HKGs have not been identified in placental tissues throughout the pregnancy of the goat. In our study, 20 HKGs were tentatively selected from RNA-seq data and previous reports. The cycle threshold (Ct) of HKGs was determined by qRT-PCR in trophoblast membrane and cotyledon villus collected from 38 Dazu Black goats on gestation days of 20, 25, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, and 150 (birth). The expression stability of the HKGs was analyzed by geNorm, Normfinder, Bestkeeper and Delta Ct algorithms, and comprehensively evaluated by ReFinder and ComprFinder. In addition, the optimal HKGs were further verified by placenta-specific genes (SPP1, VEGFA and PAG6). The 16 candidate HKGs (except POP4, TBP, RNF10, UBC) showed a qualified Ct value, less than 28. Among them, YWHAZ, EIF3K and PPIB showed the most stable expression in placental tissues during early, mid-late pregnancy and postpartum, but the least stable expression was B2M at early and mid-late stage, and PPIB at postpartum. After comprehensive analysis, RPLP0, EIF3K and YWHAZ were found to be the most stable placental HKGs throughout pregnancy. The classical HKGs, ACTB, GAPDH and 18S RNA have unstable expressions and even ranked at the bottom of the list from comprehensive index, suggesting an inappropriate for target gene normalization. Taken together, our study confirmed that YWHAZ, EIF3K, HMBS and RPLP0 may be the optimal HKGs in goat placenta at different stage of pregnancy, which provided a valuable reference of HKGs on functional gene expression detection for further research on placenta development and growth in ruminants.   \n",

Phlegm-blood stasis syndrome, one of the Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) syndrome differentiation, is the core pathogenesis dynamically throughout the occurrence, development, and prognosis of HF. Biomarkers having high sensitivity and specificity are highly demanded to facilitate the accurate differentiation of HF patients with phlegm-blood stasis syndrome. In the present study, serum samples were collected from 20 healthy controls and 40 HF patients (20 with and 20 without phlegm-blood stasis syndrome). We implemented data-independent acquisition mass spectrometry (DIA-MS) for discovery and parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) for validation of biomarkers for heart failure with phlegm-blood stasis syndrome. A total of 84 different proteins were found in the HF with phlegm-blood stasis syndrome (HF-TY) group compared with healthy controls. 37 candidate proteins were selected for the PRM assay, and five validated proteins with high sensitivity and specificity, including insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 4 (IGFBP4), β-2-microglobulin (B2M), dystroglycan (DAG1), immunoglobulin J chain (JCHAIN), and kallikrein B1 (KLKB1), were considered potential biomarkers for heart failure patients with phlegm-blood stasis syndrome. Newly identified biomarkers might provide insights into the diagnosis and treatment of HF with TCM syndrome differentiation.   \n",

Due to their desirable properties, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have recently emerged as highly promising therapeutic agents, which properties include differentiation abilit and cytokine production. While CRISPR-Cas9 technology is applied to develop MSC-based therapeutics, MSCs exhibit inefficient genome editing, and susceptibility to plasmid DNA. In this study, we compared and optimized plasmid DNA and RNP approaches for efficient genome engineering in MSCs. The RNP-mediated approach enabled genome editing with high indel frequency and low cytotoxicity in MSCs. By utilizing Cas9 RNPs, we successfully generated B2M-knockout MSCs, which reduced T-cell differentiation, and improved MSC survival. Furthermore, this approach enhanced the immunomodulatory effect of IFN-r priming. These findings indicate that the RNP-mediated engineering of MSC genomes can achieve high efficiency, and engineered MSCs offer potential as a promising therapeutic strategy.   \n",

One of the challenges associated with this method is the need to identify optimal reference genes (RGs) that maintain consistent expression levels under diverse experimental settings, thereby ensuring accurate biological interpretation. In this study, we conducted a thorough analysis of 18 candidate RGs (ACTB, BACH1, B2M, GAPDH, HMBS, HPRT1, PGK1, PPIA, PPIB, RPLP0, RPL19, RPS9, RPS15, RPS28, SDHA, TBP, UXT, and YWHAZ) across 10 ovine tissues (muscle, skin, kidney, liver, intestine, rumen, lung, testis, heart, and spleen) obtained from five individual sheep. We aimed to identify genes with stable expression across these tissues. A literature-based survey helped us shortlist candidate genes representing various functional classes from multiple livestock species. We employed four algorithms: geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, and Delta Ct (ΔCt), to rank these genes based on their stability. A consistent trend in the rankings was observed across these different algorithms. RefFinder was then used for a comprehensive ranking, integrating the outputs from the various methods. ACTB, PPIB, BACH1, and B2M emerged as the most stable RGs, while RPS9, RPS15, and PGK1 displayed variable expression. We validated our findings through qPCR analysis of four target genes (ACTN2, CRYAB, DLK1, and TRIM54) in the skin samples from two different sheep breeds. Based on these results, we recommend ACTB, PPIB, BACH1, and B2M as reliable internal control genes for qPCR experiments involving diverse ovine tissues.   \n",

Amyloidosis was localized in the bladder (3 cases), in the ureter (1 case) and in the prostate and/or seminal vesicles (4 cases). The amyloid protein was characterized in 7 cases by immunohistochemistry. Among the bladder and ureter amyloidosis, 2 cases were classified as AL lambda amyloidosis and one case as AA amyloidosis in a patient with long history of chronic arthritis. In the fourth case, the deposits could not be identified. Nevertheless an AL amyloidosis might be suggested. Two cases of prostate and/or seminal vesicles amyloidosis were stained with an anti-B2M antibody, in hemodialyzed patients. The 2 others, positive with the anti-Transthyretina antibody, were classified as senile amyloidosis. This small series illustrated the heterogeneous pathogenic types of amyloidosis in the urogenital tract and emphasized the interest of immunohistochemistry to identify the chemical composition of these deposits.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Our objective was to investigate the prognostic significance of serum beta-2 microglobulin (B2M) levels among patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). All patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive early chronic phase CML (i.e., within 1 year of diagnosis) treated with IFN alpha-based therapy at the M. D. Anderson Cancer Center between 1980 and 1997, in whom pretreatment B2M levels were available, were investigated. Two hundred one patients were evaluable. Their median B2M was 2.2 mg/dl (range, 1.1-20 mg/dl). Serum B2M levels were associated with other variables of prognostic significance, including age, spleen size, WBC count, percentage of peripheral and marrow blasts, and percentage of marrow basophils. Patients with B2M levels &gt;2.9 mg/dl (ie., the upper quartile of the distribution) had a significantly lower rate of major cytogenetic response compared to those in the lower three quartiles (20 versus 52%; P &lt; 0.01). They also had a shorter survival, with a 5-year survival rate of 48%, compared with 75% for those in the lower quartiles (P = 0.01). High B2M levels (&gt;2.9 mg/dl) could identify a group of patients with an adverse outcome within patients in stage I disease (P = 0.02). Results for patients in stages 2-4 were inconclusive because of the small number of patients in these groups. We conclude that serum B2M levels are an important, and probably independent, prognostic factor for patients with CML in early chronic phase treated with IFN-based therapy.</td>\n",

       "      <td>The effect of extremely low-frequency electromagnetic field (ELF EMF) exposures to human health has been widely debated. Epidemiological studies have found a possible correlation between increased cancer incidence and environmental ELF EMF exposures. Results from in vitro studies performed to examine the possible underlying bioeffects of ELF EMFs have varied greatly. Reported effects range from robust and reproducible effects to undetectable. In this study, Daudi cells were exposed to 60 Hz magnetic fields for 20, 40 or 60 min at flux densities of 12.5, 50, 100 or 500 microT. Exposures were performed in the Regional ELF-EMF Exposure Facility (Rockville, MD) to minimize variables that might contribute to a false positive effect. Exposures included sham/sham, exposed/sham or sham/exposed, and were performed with blinding with respect to type of exposure. 12-O-Tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) treatment was used as a positive control. Total cellular RNA was isolated using a single-step technique. Human MYC expression was measured by northern blot hybridization as an indicator of the responsiveness of Daudi cells to experimental conditions. Beta-2-microglobulin (B2M) expression was measured simultaneously as an internal control. Exposure to a 60 Hz magnetic field did not significantly alter MYC expression in Daudi cells under any of the exposure conditions.</td>\n",

We studied two different types of low-flux membranes at reuses 0, 6, and 12 in five patients undergoing hemodialysis with the following combinations of membrane and sterilant: cellulose diacetate membrane and formaldehyde, polysulfone membrane and formaldehyde, cellulose diacetate membrane and peracetic acid, and polysulfone and peracetic acid. The permeability of the membranes was assessed through the hydraulic ultrafiltration coefficient (K(UF)), sieving coefficient for beta(2)-microglobulin (B2M), and vitamin B(12) and albumin concentrations in ultrafiltrate. After 12 reuses, total cell volume (TCV) tended to be reduced in both cellulose diacetate and polysulfone dialyzers irrespective of the sterilant used, but significance was only found for the first set of dialyzers. Cellulose diacetate dialyzers reprocessed with either formaldehyde or peracetic acid showed an important reduction in K(UF) (31% [P &lt; 0.05] and 23% [P &lt; 0.05], respectively). A significant elevation in K(UF) was found in polysulfone membranes reprocessed with peracetic acid (41%; P &lt; 0.05), but no alterations in K(UF) were found in polysulfone membranes reprocessed with formaldehyde. Cellulose diacetate membranes were intrinsically more permeable to B2M than polysulfone membranes (sieving coefficient, 6. 85 +/- 2.53 versus 0.04 +/- 0.02 x 10(-2); P &lt; 0.001), which was not modified by any of the sterilants. Vitamin B(12) levels in ultrafiltrate decreased to an undetectable level in four of five samples collected after 12 reuses in polysulfone membranes reprocessed with peracetic acid (90 +/- 71 to 3 +/- 8 pg/mL; P &lt; 0. 05 versus reuse 0). Albumin leakage occurred in two of five samples after the 12th reuse, but only in polysulfone membranes reprocessed with peracetic acid. Our findings suggest that reuse of low-flux polysulfone dialyzers reprocessed with peracetic acid is associated with structural damage of the membrane and a reduced permeability to middle molecules.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Bone involvement is a central feature of multiple myeloma (MM). We investigated whether serum markers of osteoblastic and osteoclastic activity correlate with the presence of bone disease and survival in 313 MM patients enrolled in a phase III trial (E9486). Five markers were measured, including osteocalcin (OC), carboxy-terminal propeptide of type I collagen (PICP), bone alkaline phosphatase (BAP), carboxy-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen (ICTP) and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP). We analysed the relationship between serum levels of these markers and the presence of bone manifestations, and survival. Serum levels of ICTP and BAP correlated significantly with bone pain, lesions and fractures. Serum level of ICTP was also higher in stage II-III compared with stage I disease. The serum level of ICTP was significantly associated with shortened survival in the univariate analysis. The median survival times were 4.1 and 3.5 years for low and high ICTP respectively (P = 0.02). There was a strong relationship between ICTP and beta-2-micrgolobulin (B2M). ICTP stands out as a significant marker of bone disease. Incorporation of these markers into clinical trials assessing the use of bisphosphonates in MM is needed to determine whether they might serve as indicators of effectiveness of these agents.</td>\n",

We report 8 cases, often misdiagnosed as a neoplastic process (6/8). Amyloidosis was localized in the bladder (3 cases), in the ureter (1 case) and in the prostate and/or seminal vesicles (4 cases). The amyloid protein was characterized in 7 cases by immunohistochemistry. Among the bladder and ureter amyloidosis, 2 cases were classified as AL lambda amyloidosis and one case as AA amyloidosis in a patient with long history of chronic arthritis. In the fourth case, the deposits could not be identified. Nevertheless an AL amyloidosis might be suggested. Two cases of prostate and/or seminal vesicles amyloidosis were stained with an anti-B2M antibody, in hemodialyzed patients. The 2 others, positive with the anti-Transthyretina antibody, were classified as senile amyloidosis. This small series illustrated the heterogeneous pathogenic types of amyloidosis in the urogenital tract and emphasized the interest of immunohistochemistry to identify the chemical composition of these deposits.   \n",

All patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive early chronic phase CML (i.e., within 1 year of diagnosis) treated with IFN alpha-based therapy at the M. D. Anderson Cancer Center between 1980 and 1997, in whom pretreatment B2M levels were available, were investigated. Two hundred one patients were evaluable. Their median B2M was 2.2 mg/dl (range, 1.1-20 mg/dl). Serum B2M levels were associated with other variables of prognostic significance, including age, spleen size, WBC count, percentage of peripheral and marrow blasts, and percentage of marrow basophils. Patients with B2M levels >2.9 mg/dl (ie., the upper quartile of the distribution) had a significantly lower rate of major cytogenetic response compared to those in the lower three quartiles (20 versus 52%; P < 0.01). They also had a shorter survival, with a 5-year survival rate of 48%, compared with 75% for those in the lower quartiles (P = 0.01). High B2M levels (>2.9 mg/dl) could identify a group of patients with an adverse outcome within patients in stage I disease (P = 0.02). Results for patients in stages 2-4 were inconclusive because of the small number of patients in these groups. We conclude that serum B2M levels are an important, and probably independent, prognostic factor for patients with CML in early chronic phase treated with IFN-based therapy.   \n",

Epidemiological studies have found a possible correlation between increased cancer incidence and environmental ELF EMF exposures. Results from in vitro studies performed to examine the possible underlying bioeffects of ELF EMFs have varied greatly. Reported effects range from robust and reproducible effects to undetectable. In this study, Daudi cells were exposed to 60 Hz magnetic fields for 20, 40 or 60 min at flux densities of 12.5, 50, 100 or 500 microT. Exposures were performed in the Regional ELF-EMF Exposure Facility (Rockville, MD) to minimize variables that might contribute to a false positive effect. Exposures included sham/sham, exposed/sham or sham/exposed, and were performed with blinding with respect to type of exposure. 12-O-Tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) treatment was used as a positive control. Total cellular RNA was isolated using a single-step technique. Human MYC expression was measured by northern blot hybridization as an indicator of the responsiveness of Daudi cells to experimental conditions. Beta-2-microglobulin (B2M) expression was measured simultaneously as an internal control. Exposure to a 60 Hz magnetic field did not significantly alter MYC expression in Daudi cells under any of the exposure conditions.   \n",
       "4  Little attention has been given to the effects of reuse on the permeability of low-flux membranes, especially regarding middle molecules. We studied two different types of low-flux membranes at reuses 0, 6, and 12 in five patients undergoing hemodialysis with the following combinations of membrane and sterilant: cellulose diacetate membrane and formaldehyde, polysulfone membrane and formaldehyde, cellulose diacetate membrane and peracetic acid, and polysulfone and peracetic acid. The permeability of the membranes was assessed through the hydraulic ultrafiltration coefficient (K(UF)), sieving coefficient for beta(2)-microglobulin (B2M), and vitamin B(12) and albumin concentrations in ultrafiltrate. After 12 reuses, total cell volume (TCV) tended to be reduced in both cellulose diacetate and polysulfone dialyzers irrespective of the sterilant used, but significance was only found for the first set of dialyzers. Cellulose diacetate dialyzers reprocessed with either formaldehyde or peracetic acid showed an important reduction in K(UF) (31% [P < 0.05] and 23% [P < 0.05], respectively). A significant elevation in K(UF) was found in polysulfone membranes reprocessed with peracetic acid (41%; P < 0.05), but no alterations in K(UF) were found in polysulfone membranes reprocessed with formaldehyde. Cellulose diacetate membranes were intrinsically more permeable to B2M than polysulfone membranes (sieving coefficient, 6. 85 +/- 2.53 versus 0.04 +/- 0.02 x 10(-2); P < 0.001), which was not modified by any of the sterilants. Vitamin B(12) levels in ultrafiltrate decreased to an undetectable level in four of five samples collected after 12 reuses in polysulfone membranes reprocessed with peracetic acid (90 +/- 71 to 3 +/- 8 pg/mL; P < 0. 05 versus reuse 0). Albumin leakage occurred in two of five samples after the 12th reuse, but only in polysulfone membranes reprocessed with peracetic acid. Our findings suggest that reuse of low-flux polysulfone dialyzers reprocessed with peracetic acid is associated with structural damage of the membrane and a reduced permeability to middle molecules.   \n",

We investigated whether serum markers of osteoblastic and osteoclastic activity correlate with the presence of bone disease and survival in 313 MM patients enrolled in a phase III trial (E9486). Five markers were measured, including osteocalcin (OC), carboxy-terminal propeptide of type I collagen (PICP), bone alkaline phosphatase (BAP), carboxy-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen (ICTP) and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP). We analysed the relationship between serum levels of these markers and the presence of bone manifestations, and survival. Serum levels of ICTP and BAP correlated significantly with bone pain, lesions and fractures. Serum level of ICTP was also higher in stage II-III compared with stage I disease. The serum level of ICTP was significantly associated with shortened survival in the univariate analysis. The median survival times were 4.1 and 3.5 years for low and high ICTP respectively (P = 0.02). There was a strong relationship between ICTP and beta-2-micrgolobulin (B2M). ICTP stands out as a significant marker of bone disease. Incorporation of these markers into clinical trials assessing the use of bisphosphonates in MM is needed to determine whether they might serve as indicators of effectiveness of these agents.   \n",
