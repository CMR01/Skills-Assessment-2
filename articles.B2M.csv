10617805,"[Urogenital amyloidosis: clinico-pathological study of 8 cases].","Amyloidosis of the genito-urinary tract is uncommon. We report 8 cases, often misdiagnosed as a neoplastic process (6/8). Amyloidosis was localized in the bladder (3 cases), in the ureter (1 case) and in the prostate and/or seminal vesicles (4 cases). The amyloid protein was characterized in 7 cases by immunohistochemistry. Among the bladder and ureter amyloidosis, 2 cases were classified as AL lambda amyloidosis and one case as AA amyloidosis in a patient with long history of chronic arthritis. In the fourth case, the deposits could not be identified. Nevertheless an AL amyloidosis might be suggested. Two cases of prostate and/or seminal vesicles amyloidosis were stained with an anti-B2M antibody, in hemodialyzed patients. The 2 others, positive with the anti-Transthyretina antibody, were classified as senile amyloidosis. This small series illustrated the heterogeneous pathogenic types of amyloidosis in the urogenital tract and emphasized the interest of immunohistochemistry to identify the chemical composition of these deposits.","0242-6498","Annales de pathologie","(19) 487-91",1999,"M","Esslimani","M","Service d'Anatomie Pathologique, Hôpital Gui de Chauliac, 34295 Montpellier Cedex 5."
10656443,"Serum beta-2 microglobulin levels are a significant prognostic factor in Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia.","Our objective was to investigate the prognostic significance of serum beta-2 microglobulin (B2M) levels among patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). All patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive early chronic phase CML (i.e., within 1 year of diagnosis) treated with IFN alpha-based therapy at the M. D. Anderson Cancer Center between 1980 and 1997, in whom pretreatment B2M levels were available, were investigated. Two hundred one patients were evaluable. Their median B2M was 2.2 mg/dl (range, 1.1-20 mg/dl). Serum B2M levels were associated with other variables of prognostic significance, including age, spleen size, WBC count, percentage of peripheral and marrow blasts, and percentage of marrow basophils. Patients with B2M levels >2.9 mg/dl (ie., the upper quartile of the distribution) had a significantly lower rate of major cytogenetic response compared to those in the lower three quartiles (20 versus 52%; P < 0.01). They also had a shorter survival, with a 5-year survival rate of 48%, compared with 75% for those in the lower quartiles (P = 0.01). High B2M levels (>2.9 mg/dl) could identify a group of patients with an adverse outcome within patients in stage I disease (P = 0.02). Results for patients in stages 2-4 were inconclusive because of the small number of patients in these groups. We conclude that serum B2M levels are an important, and probably independent, prognostic factor for patients with CML in early chronic phase treated with IFN-based therapy.","1078-0432","Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research","(6) 147-52",2000,"J","Rodriguez","J","Department of Leukemia, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030, USA."
10790290,"Exposure of Daudi cells to low-frequency magnetic fields does not elevate MYC steady-state mRNA levels.","The effect of extremely low-frequency electromagnetic field (ELF EMF) exposures to human health has been widely debated. Epidemiological studies have found a possible correlation between increased cancer incidence and environmental ELF EMF exposures. Results from in vitro studies performed to examine the possible underlying bioeffects of ELF EMFs have varied greatly. Reported effects range from robust and reproducible effects to undetectable. In this study, Daudi cells were exposed to 60 Hz magnetic fields for 20, 40 or 60 min at flux densities of 12.5, 50, 100 or 500 microT. Exposures were performed in the Regional ELF-EMF Exposure Facility (Rockville, MD) to minimize variables that might contribute to a false positive effect. Exposures included sham/sham, exposed/sham or sham/exposed, and were performed with blinding with respect to type of exposure. 12-O-Tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) treatment was used as a positive control. Total cellular RNA was isolated using a single-step technique. Human MYC expression was measured by northern blot hybridization as an indicator of the responsiveness of Daudi cells to experimental conditions. Beta-2-microglobulin (B2M) expression was measured simultaneously as an internal control. Exposure to a 60 Hz magnetic field did not significantly alter MYC expression in Daudi cells under any of the exposure conditions.","0033-7587","Radiation research","(153) 663-9",2000,"C A","Morehouse","CA","FDA Center for Devices and Radiological Health, Rockville, Maryland 20850, USA."
10793017,"Effects of dialyzer reuse on the permeability of low-flux membranes.","Little attention has been given to the effects of reuse on the permeability of low-flux membranes, especially regarding middle molecules. We studied two different types of low-flux membranes at reuses 0, 6, and 12 in five patients undergoing hemodialysis with the following combinations of membrane and sterilant: cellulose diacetate membrane and formaldehyde, polysulfone membrane and formaldehyde, cellulose diacetate membrane and peracetic acid, and polysulfone and peracetic acid. The permeability of the membranes was assessed through the hydraulic ultrafiltration coefficient (K(UF)), sieving coefficient for beta(2)-microglobulin (B2M), and vitamin B(12) and albumin concentrations in ultrafiltrate. After 12 reuses, total cell volume (TCV) tended to be reduced in both cellulose diacetate and polysulfone dialyzers irrespective of the sterilant used, but significance was only found for the first set of dialyzers. Cellulose diacetate dialyzers reprocessed with either formaldehyde or peracetic acid showed an important reduction in K(UF) (31% [P < 0.05] and 23% [P < 0.05], respectively). A significant elevation in K(UF) was found in polysulfone membranes reprocessed with peracetic acid (41%; P < 0.05), but no alterations in K(UF) were found in polysulfone membranes reprocessed with formaldehyde. Cellulose diacetate membranes were intrinsically more permeable to B2M than polysulfone membranes (sieving coefficient, 6. 85 +/- 2.53 versus 0.04 +/- 0.02 x 10(-2); P < 0.001), which was not modified by any of the sterilants. Vitamin B(12) levels in ultrafiltrate decreased to an undetectable level in four of five samples collected after 12 reuses in polysulfone membranes reprocessed with peracetic acid (90 +/- 71 to 3 +/- 8 pg/mL; P < 0. 05 versus reuse 0). Albumin leakage occurred in two of five samples after the 12th reuse, but only in polysulfone membranes reprocessed with peracetic acid. Our findings suggest that reuse of low-flux polysulfone dialyzers reprocessed with peracetic acid is associated with structural damage of the membrane and a reduced permeability to middle molecules.","1523-6838","American journal of kidney diseases : the official journal of the National Kidney Foundation","(35) 839-44",2000,"J P","Matos","JP","Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Nephrology, and Department of Pathology, Universidade Federal Fluminense, Niterói, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil."
10848778,"Prognostic value of serum markers of bone metabolism in untreated multiple myeloma patients.","Bone involvement is a central feature of multiple myeloma (MM). We investigated whether serum markers of osteoblastic and osteoclastic activity correlate with the presence of bone disease and survival in 313 MM patients enrolled in a phase III trial (E9486). Five markers were measured, including osteocalcin (OC), carboxy-terminal propeptide of type I collagen (PICP), bone alkaline phosphatase (BAP), carboxy-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen (ICTP) and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP). We analysed the relationship between serum levels of these markers and the presence of bone manifestations, and survival. Serum levels of ICTP and BAP correlated significantly with bone pain, lesions and fractures. Serum level of ICTP was also higher in stage II-III compared with stage I disease. The serum level of ICTP was significantly associated with shortened survival in the univariate analysis. The median survival times were 4.1 and 3.5 years for low and high ICTP respectively (P = 0.02). There was a strong relationship between ICTP and beta-2-micrgolobulin (B2M). ICTP stands out as a significant marker of bone disease. Incorporation of these markers into clinical trials assessing the use of bisphosphonates in MM is needed to determine whether they might serve as indicators of effectiveness of these agents.","0007-1048","British journal of haematology","(109) 24-9",2000,"R","Fonseca","R","Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Rochester, MN 55905, USA."
10879242,"Comparison of alpha-fetoprotein with some other tumour markers in Malaysians with hepatocellular carcinoma.","Although alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) is regarded as the reference marker for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), it sometimes produces false results. The objective of this study was to see if some of the readily available laboratory markers could complement AFP to improve the laboratory diagnosis of HCC. The markers tested and their sensitivities were: CA 125, 92%; ferritin, 71.3%; CA 19-9, 69.8%; beta-2-microglobulin (B2M), 53.3%; CA 72-4, 13.6%; and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), 10.6%. In comparison, AFP had a sensitivity of 58.8%. CA 72-4 and CEA (at the ""tumour"" cut-off level of 20 ng/ml) had specificities of 100%, and AFP, 97.4%. The specificities of the other markers were less impressive: CEA, 77.8% (at the cut-off level of 5 ng/ml); ferritin, 48.6%; CA 125, 48.5%; B2M, 39.6%; and CA 19-9, 37.3%. The efficiencies of the markers for HCC, which are based on the consideration of sensitivity and specificity together, were as follows: AFP, 77.6%; CA 125, 71.3%; ferritin, 60.5%; CA 19-9, 55.3; B2M, 46.9%; CEA, 40.8%; and CA 72-4, 34.5%. The receiver-operating characteristic plots confirmed AFP to be the most efficient marker for HCC. Nevertheless, it is proposed that CA 125 be combined with AFP for HCC screening because of their excellent sensitivity and specificity, respectively: a negative result for both, or even just CA 125 alone, would indicate that the disease is unlikely while a positive AFP (which would likely occur with a positive CA 125) would make its presence highly probable. A positive CA 125 and negative AFP would be equivocal for HCC. Other markers in combination with AFP are less useful.","0126-8635","The Malaysian journal of pathology","(19) 53-8",1997,"J B","Lopez","JB","Division of Endocrinology, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur."
10951865,"[Relation of the soluble cytoadhesion molecules VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 to selected clinical and laboratory indicators in multiple myeloma].","Hitherto conducted studies concerned with the problem of cytoadhesive molecules (CAM) dealt only in a very limited way with the problem of multiple myeloma (MM). The subject of the submitted paper was evaluation of the relationship of soluble forms of ""vascular cell adhesive molecule-1"" (sVCAM-1) and ""intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1"" (sICAM-1) in serum from the peripheral bloodstream (PBS) and serum from a bone marrow aspirate (BMA) with selected clinical and laboratory indicators of MM (beta 2-microglobulin, thymidine kinase, immunochemical type of MM, S-creatinine, S-monoclonal immunoglobulin, S-albumin, Hb, percentage ratio of plasmocytes in bone marrow, age, performance status, stage and substage of MM and activity of disease) and proliferation characteristics of myeloma plasmocytes. The authors analyzed two groups of patients with MM, a group of 64 examined in different stages of MM and a group of 39 examined when the diagnosis of MM was established (median age 63 and 64 years, male/female ratio 1.6 and 1.3:1). The sVCAM-1 and sICAM-1 levels were examined by the ELISA method. Elevated values of sVCAM-1 in PBS were recorded in both groups in 87.5% and 87% patients, medians of sVCAM-1 exceeded the upper range of normal values (714 ng/ml) almost twice (1180 and 1295 ng/ml) whereby median values in BMA (1347 and 1546 ng/ml) were always somewhat higher than in PBS. Elevated sICAM-1 values in PBS were found in 35 and 33% patients, median levels of sICAM-1 in PBS and in BMA did not exceed the upper normal range (691 ng/ml) and did not differ substantially (518 vs. 476 and 518 vs. 500 ng/ml). Correlation analysis (Pearson's correlation coefficient and Mann-Whitney's test, p0.05) revealed in both groups a significant relationship of both CAM assessed in PBS and BMA (sVCAM-1 p-0.0000 and p-0.012, sICAM-1 p-0.0000 and p-0.0011). No relationship was found between sVCAM-1 and s-ICAM-1 levels assessed in PBS and BMA with proliferation indexes of myeloma plasmocytes, i.e. values of the propidium-iodide index PI/CD38 and PI/B-B4 (CD138). In the whole group of 64 patients a relationship was found between sVCAM-1 in PBS and values of S-creatinine (p - 0.004), Hb (p - 0.033), S-albumin (p - 0.035), S-beta 2-microglobulin (S-B2M) (p - 0.0000) and S-thymidine kinase (S-TK)(p-0.0000), when evaluating BMA, a relationship with B2M (p -0.011). In the group of 39 patients examined when the diagnosis of MM was made a relationship was found of sVCAM-1 in PBS to S-B2M) (p - 0.0000), S-TK (p-0.0000) and to S-creatinine (p -0.005), in BMA there was only a relationship with B2M (p - 0.020). In the whole group of 64 patients there was no relationship between s-ICAM levels in PBS with any of the examined indicators, when evaluating BMA only a relationship with B2M (p - 0.038) and TK (p - 0.022). In the group of 39 patients examined during the diagnosis of MM a relationship was found of sICAM-1 only with B2M in BMA (p - 0.013). In the total group of 64 a relationship was found between sVCAM-1 in PBS with the patient's age (p - 0.032) and the substage of MM(p-0.024), in the group of 39 patients a relationship between sVCAM on PBS and the substage of MM (p -0.031). On analysis of sICAM-1 a relationship was found between levels in BMA only with the patient's age (p -0.015). From the investigation ensued that despite evidence of a number of correlations between sVCAM and sICAM-1 levels and clinical and laboratory indicators of MM no relationship was found which could be applied under conditions of clinical practice. Assessment of levels of different indicators in serum of bone marrow aspirate did not reveal any advantages over examination in peripheral blood serum.","0042-773X","Vnitrni lekarstvi","(45) 583-90",1999,"V","Scudla","V","III. interní klinika LF UP a FN, Olomouc."
11148456,"Pathogenesis of beta2-microglobulin amyloidosis.","Hemodialysis-related amyloidosis is a relatively new form of systemic amyloidosis, with beta2-microglobulin (B2M) being identified as the major constituent protein. Most of the clinical findings are related to amyloid deposition in osseo-articular tissues. B2M amyloid deposits first appear in the cervical intervertebral discs, which are well known to be susceptible to mechanical stress. A close relationship between changes of microenvironment caused by such stress and amyloid deposition is highly suggested. In advanced cases, an inflammatory reaction composed of macrophages, multinucleated giant cells, and granulation tissue, is observed around the amyloid deposits. Purified amyloid protein is native B2M, and mutations and proteolysis are not believed to be important for its deposition. Plasma levels of B2M are elevated as much as 5-10 times because of the inability of hemodialysis equipment removal of B2M from blood plasma, the duration being very important for B2M amyloid fibrillogenesis. Heparan sulfate proteoglycans, perlecan, is increased at the same sites of amyloid deposits from the early stages. In B2M amyloidosis, an increase of heparan sulfate proteoglycans is observed in the vascular wall and synovium, but in the discs, ligaments and cartilage, there is an increase of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans predominantly. B2M has an affinity for heparan sulfate proteoglycans, although it is weaker than that for laminin and type IV collagen. This is related to the interactions between negative charges of sulfate groups of proteoglycans and positive charges of basic amino acids in N-terminal side of B2M. Increased cytokines production in the synovium, induced by advanced glycation end products as well as elevated plasma levels, is also linked to inflammatory reactions. Increased expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP), especially MMP-1 and -9, is related to the destructive changes of the bone and cartilage. The decrease of plasma levels by high flux membrane and control of inflammatory reactions are very important for prevention of B2M amyloidosis.","1320-5463","Pathology international","(51) 1-10",2001,"K","Ohashi","K","Department of Pathology, Tokyo Metropolitan Komagome Hospital, 3-18-22, Honkomagome, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-0021, Japan. ohashi.k-k@komagome-hospital.bunkyo.tokyo.jp"
11261557,"Genetic variation among chicken lines and mammalian species in specific genes.","Thirteen gene-specific primer sets provided by the U.S. Poultry Genome Coordinators were used to investigate DNA polymorphisms between two highly inbred chicken lines of Leghorn and Fayoumi origin. Nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequences were then compared among these chicken lines and the Genbank sequences of chicken, mouse, and human. The following genes were selected as candidates for immune response or transcription activation: B2M, DAD1, IAP1, IL2, IREB1, LAP18, MAFL, POU1F1, RREB1, TAD, TBP1, TCRG, and ZOV3. Total cDNA was obtained from the spleens of Leghorn and Fayoumi lines by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and was used as a template to PCR-amplify gene-specific products. All primers except POU1F1 and TCRG generated single PCR products of the predicted 325- to 667-bp size, confirming the efficacy of these gene-specific primers in the chicken. Three and seven of the 11 amplified gene fragments yielded line-specific nucleotide polymorphisms between the Leghorn and Fayoumi sequences and between the Leghorn and Genbank chicken sequences respectively. Similarities between inbred Leghorn and mammalian species were 36 to 86% for nucleotides and 25 to 96% for predicted amino acid sequence. The polymorphisms of some gene fragments between the Leghorn and Fayoumi lines will allow for investigation of associations of these genes with immune response and other biological traits.","0032-5791","Poultry science","(80) 284-8",2001,"H","Zhou","H","Department of Animal Science, Iowa State University, Ames 50011-3150, USA."

Although one of these transitions is severely blended, so that an accurate intensity and line width could not be determined, and two other lines are only marginally detected, we have done Gaussian fits to the remaining seven lines and have performed a rotation diagram analysis. Our results indicate a rotation temperature T(rot) = 18 K and a molecular column density N(c-C2H4O) = 3.3 x 10(14) cm-2, corresponding to a fractional abundance relative to molecular hydrogen of order 6 x 10(-11). This is a factor of more than 200 higher than the abundance for this molecule suggested by the ""new standard"" chemistry model of Lee, Bettens, & Herbst.

11710195,"Influence of alkali cation nature on structural transitions and reactions of biopolyelectrolytes.","A general thermodynamic analysis is presented, describing how counterion species of different nature, but the same valency, influence polyelectrolyte transformations and reactions of the general form: PA1.B1-M(+)-->PA2.B2M+ + (B1 - B2)M+. Here PA1 and PA2 are two different states or structural forms of a polyanion, B1 and B2 are the number of M+ ions thermodynamically bound to the polyanions PA1 and PA2, respectively. The specific effects of the two counterions, M1+ and M2+, on this equilibrium can be simply related to the quotient of their selectivity constants, D2M2M1/D1M2M1, for the polyion states 1 and 2. We analyze how different monovalent counterions (particularly, sodium and potassium) affect polyelectrolyte reactions and transformations such as, e.g., the DNA helix-coil transition. Previous experimental results on the competition between DNA and the synthetic polyanion, poly(methacrylic acid), for binding to the synthetic polycation, poly(N-ethylvinylpyridinium), has been investigated with respect to sodium and potassium ion specificity, using our model.

Twelve housekeeping genes commonly used as controls in classical expression studies (including GAPD, ACTB, B2M, TUBA, G6PD, LDHA, and HPRT) show considerable variability of expression both within and across microarray datasets. Although we can identify genes with lower variability within individual datasets by heuristic filtering, such genes invariably show different expression levels when compared across other microarray datasets. We confirm these results with an analysis of variance in a controlled mouse dataset, showing the extent of variability in gene expression across tissues. The results show the problems inherent in the classical use of control genes in estimating gene expression levels in different mammalian cell contexts, and highlight the importance of controlled study design in the construction of microarray experiments.","1088-9051","Genome research","(12) 292-7",2002,"Peter D","Lee","PD","Montreal Genome Centre, McGill University Health Centre, Montreal H3G 1A4, Quebec, Canada."

METHODS: A cross-sectional study was performed at four drug detoxification centers in Barcelona, and the HIV outpatient clinic at Hospital Clínic in Barcelona. Three cohorts of intravenous drug abusers (IVDAs)-105 HIV-1-uninfected patients (cohort A), 174 with asymptomatic HIV-1 infection (cohort B) and 39 with AIDS (cohort C)-were enrolled. On the first visit, the following laboratory tests were performed: hemogram and platelet count, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), anti-hepatitis C antibodies, B2M, NP, sIL-2R, TNF-alpha, and TNF receptors (sTNF-R55 and sTNF-R75). RESULTS: The three cohorts were homogeneous according to sex, type of drug, average number of intravenous doses of drug in 1 day, and hepatitis B infection. Patients with AIDS were older than those of cohort A and B (p<0.0001). HIV-negative IVDAs were co-infected with hepatitis C virus less frequently than were HIV-positive IVDAs (80% versus 91%, p<0.03). Among HIV-1-negative IVDAs (cohort A), almost all (from 86% to 95%, depending on the marker) individual values were within the normal boundaries of our laboratory. With a single exception (level of sTNF-R55 in cohort B compared with cohort A, p=0.15), levels of all markers were significantly higher in asymptomatic HIV-1-infected (cohort B) when compared with uninfected patients (cohort A), and in AIDS patients (cohort C) when compared with both cohorts A and B. There was a significant positive correlation between levels of ss2M and NP (r=0.56; p<0.01), ss2M and TNF (r=0.65, p<0.01) and NP and TNF (r=0.76, p<0.01). There was no correlation between levels of sIL-2R and levels of ss2M, NP or TNF and its receptors. CONCLUSIONS: Intravenous drug abuse does not modify serum levels of ss2M, NP, sIL-2R, TNF-alpha, and TNF receptors (sTNF-R55 and sTNF-R75). Levels of these markers increase significantly when an HIV-1 infection occurs and when there is progression to AIDS.","1469-0691","Clinical microbiology and infection : the official publication of the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases","(4) 4-10",1998,"José Luis","Bedini","JL","Laboratory of Clinical Biochemistry."

The B2M-/- and control C57BL/6 (B2M+/+) mice were fed diets with different iron contents. Increasing the iron availability increased plasma iron levels in both B2M+/+ and B2M-/- mice. Reducing the iron availability decreased the plasma iron concentration in B2M+/+ mice but was without effect on plasma iron in B2M-/- mice. DMT1 was not detectable in mice fed normal or iron-loaded diets when using immunohistochemistry. In Western blots, however, the protein was consistently observed regardless of the dietary regimen. DMT1 expression was increased to the same extent in B2M+/+ and B2M-/- mice when fed an iron-poor diet. In both strains of mice fed an iron-poor diet, DMT1 was evenly distributed in the differentiated enterocytes from the base to the tip of the villi but was absent from the crypts of Lieberkühn. These data suggest that the observed effects were due to the state of iron deficiency in mucosal cells rather than genetic defect.","0193-1857","American journal of physiology.

12200701,"Long-term results (12 years) of high-dose therapy in 127 patients with de novo multiple myeloma.","This report describes the long-term outcome of a cohort of 127 de novo multiple myeloma patients treated with at least one course of high-dose therapy (HDT) in a single institution between June 1985 and December 1995, for whom the minimum follow-up duration for survivors is 6 years. The 12-year overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) rates are 24.9% and 3.1%, respectively, and the median survival and EFS are 49 and 17 months, respectively. Only four patients are alive and disease-free 79, 90, 132 and 153 after the first HDT, respectively. Three of them received a subsequent allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. Three factors significantly influence OS in this series: B2M at diagnosis, age, and the completion of a second HDT. The 10-year survival is 18.9% for the group of patients with B2M level >3 mg/l at diagnosis as compared with 41% for patients with B2M < or =3, with a median survival of 31 months vs 73 (P = 0.01). The 10-year survival is 23.4% for the group of patients aged >55 years as compared with 36.5% for patients aged <55 years, with a median survival of 34.5 months vs 70.5 (P = 0.04). The 10-year survival is 20.4% for the group of patients who did not receive a second HDT as compared with 35.2% for patients who completed a second HDT, with a median survival of 29 months vs 70 (P = 0.02). In this study we show that some patients treated with HDT experience durable remission and prolonged survival. This survival is significantly influenced by age (< or =55 years), B2M at diagnosis (< or =3 mg/l) and by the completion of two cycles of HDT.","0887-6924","Leukemia","(16) 1838-43",2002,"P","Moreau","P","Department of Hematology, University Hospital, Nantes, France."
12218113,"Recruitment of CTL activity by tumor-specific antibody-mediated targeting of single-chain class I MHC-peptide complexes.","The MHC class I-restricted CD8 CTL effector arm of the adaptive immune response is uniquely equipped to recognize tumor cells as foreign and consequently initiates the cascade of events resulting in their destruction. However, tumors have developed sophisticated strategies to escape immune effector mechanisms; their most well-known strategy is down-regulation of MHC class I molecules. To overcome this and develop new approaches for immunotherapy, we have constructed a recombinant molecule in which a single-chain MHC is specifically targeted to tumor cells through its fusion to cancer-specific recombinant Ab fragments. As a model we used a single-chain HLA-A2 molecule genetically fused to the variable domains of an anti-IL-2Ralpha subunit-specific humanized Ab, anti-Tac. The construct, termed B2M-aTac(dsFv), was expressed in Escherichia coli, and functional molecules were produced by in vitro refolding in the presence of HLA-A2-restricted antigenic peptides. Flow cytometry studies revealed the ability to decorate Ag-positive, HLA-A2-negative human tumor cells with HLA-A2-peptide complexes in a manner that was entirely dependent upon the specificity of the targeting Ab fragment. Most importantly, the B2M-aTac(dsFv)-mediated coating of the target tumor cells made them susceptible for efficient and specific HLA-A2-restricted, melanoma gp100 peptide-specific CTL-mediated lysis. These results demonstrate the concept that Ab-guided, Ag-specific targeting of MHC-peptide complexes on tumor cells can render them susceptible and more receptive and thus potentiate CTL killing. This type of approach may open the way for the development of new immunotherapeutic strategies based on Ab targeting of natural cognate MHC ligands and CTL-based cytotoxic mechanisms.","0022-1767","Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)","(169) 2988-96",2002,"Avital","Lev","A","Faculty of Biology, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel."

Furthermore, the three tumours associated with metastasis and adverse patient outcome showed normal N-MYC copy number.

Extraction of total RNA from 71 frozen leukaemic bone marrow samples obtained at the time of diagnosis produced a median yield of 145 micro g/ml leukaemic bone marrow. Total RNA samples could be reverse transcribed into cDNA and used successfully in the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction amplification of B2M transcripts in 68 of 71 cases. A multivariate linear regression analysis revealed that significant predictors of RNA yield were both sample volume (< 1 ml v > 1 ml; p = 0.003) and peripheral blood white cell count (< 5 x 10(9) v >or= 5 x 10(9) white blood cells/litre; p = 0.011). The percentage of blasts present, leukaemia subtype, and sample storage period at -80 degrees C (up to 945 days) were not predictors of total RNA yield. This method of total RNA extraction should be of interest to diagnostic and research staff using frozen bone marrow samples for molecular analyses. Similarly, the lack of association between sample storage period at -80 degrees C and total RNA yield should be of interest to the administrators of tumour banks housing frozen bone marrow samples.","0021-9746","Journal of clinical pathology","(55) 865-7",2002,"D","Barbaric","D","Molecular Oncology Laboratory, Oncology Research Unit, The Children's Hospital at Westmead, Locked Bag 4001, Westmead 2145, NSW, Australia."

Tumor cells may present tumor-specific antigen to T cells via these molecules, but many tumors show a loss or down-regulation of HLA class I expression and this may serve as an immune escape mechanism. Using a microsatellite marker-based method, we have searched for loss of heterozygosity (LOH) mutations at 3 genomic regions implicated in HLA class I expression in a cohort of 56 acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) samples. The regions analyzed consisted of the HLA class I heavy chain genes located within the MHC genomic region on chromosome arm 6p, the HLA class I light chain (beta-2-microglobulin, B2M) gene on chromosome arm 15q, and the putative HLA modifier of methylation gene (MEMO1) located on chromosome arm 1q. Results revealed low frequencies of B2M (2/55) and MEMO1 (5/42) LOH but a high frequency of MHC LOH (19/56) that was usually associated with whole chromosome 6 loss (13/19). Cytogenetic data were available for 30 samples, including nine of those that exhibited apparent whole chromosome 6 loss. No cases of chromosome 6 monosomy were observed. We propose that whole chromosome 6 loss with reduplication of the remaining chromosome is common in ALL and that it is driven by the presence of tumor-inhibiting factors on chromosome arm 6p (the HLA loci) along with previously localized tumor-suppressor genes on chromosome arm 6q.","1045-2257","Genes, chromosomes & cancer","(37) 321-5",2003,"Christopher R E","McEvoy","CR","Department of Haematology and Genetic Pathology, Flinders Medical Centre and Flinders University of South Australia, Bedford Park, Australia. chris.mcevoy@flinders.edu.au"

In order to correct variations in RNA quality and quantity and to calculate the sensitivity of each measurement, a control gene (CG) transcript should be amplified in parallel to the FG transcript. To identify suitable CGs, a study group within the Europe Against Cancer (EAC) program initially focused on 14 potential CGs using a standardized RQ-PCR protocol. Based on the absence of pseudogenes and the level and stability of the CG expression, three genes were finally selected: Abelson (ABL), beta-2-microglobulin (B2M), and beta-glucuronidase (GUS). A multicenter prospective study on normal (n=126) and diagnostic leukemic (n=184) samples processed the same day has established reference values for the CG expression. A multicenter retrospective study on over 250 acute and chronic leukemia samples obtained at diagnosis and with an identified FG transcript confirmed that the three CGs had a stable expression in the different types of samples. However, only ABL gene transcript expression did not differ significantly between normal and leukemic samples at diagnosis. We therefore propose to use the ABL gene as CG for RQ-PCR-based diagnosis and MRD detection in leukemic patients. Overall, these data are not only eligible for quantification of fusion gene transcripts, but also for the quantification of aberrantly expressed genes.","0887-6924","Leukemia","(17) 2474-86",2003,"E","Beillard","E","Department of Hematological Biology, Institute Paoli Calmettes, Marseille, France."

A principal component of antibody transport is the neonatal receptor for the Fc portion of immunoglobulin, a heterodimer of a MHC-1 alpha-chain homolog ( FCGRT) and beta-2-microglobulin ( B2M). Previously, two FCGRT haplotypes were associated with differences in immunoglobulin G (IgG) passive transfer in cattle (Laegreid et al. (2002) Mamm Genome 13, 704-710). The present study had two objectives: first, to characterize the B2M haplotype structure in a diverse group of U.S. beef cattle, and second, to evaluate those haplotypes for association with either high or low serum IgG levels in newborn calves. Twelve single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), assorted into eight haplotypes, were identified by sequencing regions of B2M exons II and IV in a multi-breed panel of 96 beef cattle. Calves homozygous for one of the eight haplotypes ( B2M 2,2) were at increased risk of FPT (odds ratio = 10.60, CI(95%) 2.07-54.24, p = 0.005). These results indicate that this haplotype is in linkage disequilibrium with genetic risk factors affecting passive transfer of IgG in beef calves, an important determinant of neonatal calf morbidity and mortality.","0938-8990","Mammalian genome : official journal of the International Mammalian Genome Society","(15) 227-36",2004,"Michael L","Clawson","ML","United States Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service, U.S. Meat Animal Research Center (MARC), Spur 18D, P.O.

THH-induced apoptosis was observed using flow cytometry, confocal fluorescence microscope, and DNA laddering and caspase assays. The molecular mechanism involved in the induction of HL-60 cell apoptosis by THH alkaloids was examined using cDNA microarrays containing 3000 human genes derived from a leukocyte cDNA library. Sixteen genes were identified to be differentially expressed in HL-60 cells upon THH treatment. Several genes related to the NF-kappaB signaling pathway and cell apoptosis (such as NFKBIB, PRG1 and B2M) were up-regulated. In addition, c-myc binding protein and apoptosis-related cysteine proteases caspase-3 and caspase-8 were also regulated. The changes in c-Myc RNA expression and c-myc protein level were further confirmed by RT-PCR and Western blot analysis.

During episodes of acute rejection serum levels of beta-2 microglobulin (B2M) are elevated due to decreased excretion and/or increased production from T-cell proliferation. Sequential measurement of B2M in the first months after transplantation may detect patients at increased risk of rejection. This study assesses the usefulness of serum B2M for early detection of patients with increased risk of cytomegalovirus disease. Among 16 of 18 cases of CMV infection, there was an increase in serum B2M levels before CMV diagnosis. In all cases, B2M serum levels increased at an average of 10.8 days before the symptoms or the positive antigenemia. From a mean baseline B2M value of 5.0 mg/L, the mean value at the time of diagnosis was 7.7 mg/L before any clinical or laboratory evidence of CMV infection. These findings suggest that B2M serum levels can be used as a marker for early diagnosis of cytomegalovirus infection.","0041-1345","Transplantation proceedings","(36) 894-5",2004,"A C Carvalho","Matos","AC","Division of Renal Transplantation, Albert Einstein Jewish Hospital, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil. accmatos@einstein.br"

Seventeen workers (14 males, 3 females) were diagnosed with occupational Cd poisoning in 1986. These individuals had between 7 to 39 years of Cd exposure. From 1986 to 1999, patients received periodic EDTA therapy as part of their follow-up, all at the same hospital. Levels of urinary cadmium (UCd) and urinary beta2-microglobulin (B2M) were measured before and after each annual EDTA treatment period. Renal dysfunction was defined as urinary B2M > 0.8 mg/g Cr (creatinine). In these workers, patients with UCd level higher than 10 microg/g Cr in 1986 had abnormal B2M excretions (> or = 0.8 mg/g Cr) or trended to have abnormal B2M levels during the treatment period. However, in subjects with UCd concentration lower than 10 microg/g Cr in 1986, their urinary B2M excretions either remained normal (< 0.8 mg/g Cr) or returned to normal during the treatment period. The prevalence of renal dysfunction increased during the follow up period regardless of whether UCd levels increased or not, indicating a progressive renal dysfunction despite removal from Cd exposure. Our results suggest that reversibility of renal dysfunction caused by Cd related to the level of Cd exposure at the time of removal from exposure: renal dysfunction could be reversed if initial UCd < 10 microg/g Cr, but was irreversible when UCd > 10 microg/g Cr. Repeated examinations on these 17 Cd exposed workers from 1986 to 1999 also revealed that periodic administration of EDTA had no beneficial effects on chronic Cd-induced renal dysfunction.","0966-0844","Biometals : an international journal on the role of metal ions in biology, biochemistry, and medicine","(17) 435-41",2004,"Xunwei","Wu","X","Department of Occupational Health, School of Public Health, Fudan University, 200032 Shanghai, China."

Four hundred twenty five MM patients >65 years were uniformly treated with chemotherapy (MP or VCMP/VBAD). Multivariate analysis identified 4 factors with independent unfavorable prognostic influence: high percentage of S-phase bone marrow plasma cells (>2.5%); elevated beta(2) microglobulin (B2M) (>4 mg/L); age >80 years old; and LDH serum levels (above normal limit). The S-phase value was the most powerful independent prognostic factor to discriminate subgroups of patients with different prognosis. Thus, 3 main risk categories could be identified according to S-phase values: </=1%, 1-3% and >3%, with median survivals of 34, 22 and 12 months, respectively (p < 0.0001). Our study also proved the value for elderly patients of the recently developed International Score System (ISS) based on B2M and albumin. Furthermore, the number of S-phase cells helped to subdivide the ISS III Group identifying a subset of patients with very poor prognosis defined by an additional high S-phase, who displayed a median survival of only 8 months. These results demonstrate that elderly patients can be accurately classified according to prognosis, which may be particularly valuable when comparing the efficacy of new treatment strategies.

Use of unconfirmed reference genes may lead to misinterpretation of the expression of target genes. The aim of this study was to adapt an adequate statistical approach to identify and validate reference genes suitable for normalization in qRT-PCR assays. We introduce the equivalence test for the identification of stably expressed reference genes. To evaluate the advantages of this test, the expression of five genes widely used as reference genes (18S, B2M, HPRT1, LMNB1, and SDHA), and of two target genes (TP53 and MMP2), was determined with qRT-PCR in different tissues (clear cell renal cell carcinoma, colon carcinoma, and gastrointestinal stromal tumors). We demonstrate that a stable expression of a reference gene in one tumor type does not predict a stable expression in another tumor type. In addition, we found that even within one tumor type, the expression of a reference gene was not stable for different biological groupwise comparisons. These observations confirm that there is no universal reference gene and underline the importance of specific validation of potential reference genes for any experimental condition.","0003-2697","Analytical biochemistry","(335) 1-9",2004,"Florian","Haller","F","Department of Pathology, Georg-August University of Göttingen, D-37075 Göttingen, Germany. florian.haller@stud.uni-goettingen.de"

We selected 44 residents, who once were employed in a smelter and lived in a cadmium-polluted area, as group A. Another 88 subjects, who never worked in the plant, but lived in the same area, were selected as group B. Group C consisted of 88 subjects who had no history of occupational exposure to cadmium and lived in a non-cadmium-polluted area. Statistical analysis demonstrated that there was no significant difference in age or gender among the three groups, nor were there significant differences in smoking habits. The prevalence of renal dysfunction as indicated by increased excretion of beta2-microglobulin (B2M), N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAG) and albumin (ALB), was higher in group A than in group B. This finding suggests that exposure to cadmium both occupationally and environmentally results in a higher prevalence of renal dysfunction, relative to those who are exposed to cadmium only in the general environment. Therefore, this specific population, who once were occupationally exposed to cadmium and lived in polluted areas, should be identified. Furthermore, health examinations of this population should be conducted in time to prevent further health damage induced by cadmium exposure.","0966-0844","Biometals : an international journal on the role of metal ions in biology, biochemistry, and medicine","(17) 513-8",2004,"Taiyi","Jin","T","Department of Occupational Health, School of Public Health, Fudan University 200032 Shanghai, PR China."

There was a significantly increased prevalence of hyperNAGuria, hyperNAG-Buria, hyperB2Muria, hyperRBPuria and hyperALBuria with increasing levels of Cd excretion in urine. We used the benchmark dose (BMD) procedure to estimate the critical concentration of urinary cadmium in this general population. The lower confidence limit of the BMD (LBMD-05) of urinary cadmium for a 5% level of risk above the background level was estimated for each of the renal effect indicators.

Our findings suggest, based on the present study, that the Lower Confidence Limit of the Population Critical Concentration of UCd (LPCCUCd-05) of tubular dysfunction for 5% excess risk level above the background may be ca. 3-4 microg/g creatinine, and that cadmium concentration in urine should be kept below this level to prevent renal tubular damage.

Pleural tissue infiltration was found on pleural biopsy and autopsy in one patient each. Systemic chemotherapy comprising dexamethasone, cyclophosphamide, etoposide and cisplatin (DCEP) (n=7) and pleurodesis (n=7) were effective in resolving MPE but survival was short. High dose chemotherapy with peripheral blood stem cell support for MPE in six patients conferred no clear survival advantage. These patients died at median of four months from onset of MPE. Patients with bone marrow complex karyotypic abnormalities including deletion-13 (n=9) had a shorter (median--18 months) overall survival compared to patients with normal cytogenetics (median--38 months). MPE in patients with MM is often associated with high-risk disease including deletion 13 chromosomal abnormality and heralds a poor prognosis despite aggressive local and systemic treatment.","1042-8194","Leukemia & lymphoma","(46) 1137-42",2005,"R","Kamble","R","Hematology-Oncology Section, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, USA. kamble@sbcglobal.net"
16211407,"Gene expression studies in prostate cancer tissue: which reference gene should be selected for normalization?","Using quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), reference genes are utilized as endogenous controls for relative quantification of target genes in gene profiling studies. The suitability of housekeeping genes for that purpose in prostate cancer tissue has not been sufficiently investigated so far. The objective of this study was to select from a panel of 16 potential candidate reference genes the most stable genes for gene normalization. Expression of mRNA encoding ACTB, ALAS1, ALB, B2M, G6PD, GAPD, HMBS, HPRT1, K-ALPHA-1, POLR2A, PPIA, RPL13A, SDHA, TBP, UBC, and YWHAZ was examined in matched, microdissected malignant and nonmalignant tissue specimens obtained from 17 nontreated prostate carcinomas after radical prostatectomy by real-time RT-PCR. The genes studied displayed a wide expression range with cycle threshold values between 16 and 37. The expression was not different between samples from pT2 and pT3 tumors or between samples with Gleason scores <7 and >or=7 (P>0.05). ACTB, RPL13A, and HMBS showed significant differences (P<0.02 at least) in expressions between malignant and nonmalignant pairs. All other genes did not differ between the matched pairs, and the software programs geNorm and NormFinder were used to ascertain the most suitable reference genes from these candidates. HPRT1, ALAS1, and K-ALPHA-1 were calculated by both programs to be the most stable genes covering a broad range of expression. The expression of the target gene RECK normalized with HRPT1 alone and with the normalization factors generated by the combination of these three reference genes as well as with the unstable genes ACTB or RPL13A is given. That example shows the significance of using suitable reference genes to avoid erroneous normalizations in gene profiling studies for prostate cancer. The use of HPRT1 alone as a reference gene shown in our study was sufficient, but the normalization factors generated from two (HRPT1, ALAS1) or all three genes (HRPT1, ALAS1, K-ALPHA-1) should be considered for an improved reliability of normalization in gene profiling studies of prostate cancer.","0946-2716","Journal of molecular medicine (Berlin, Germany)","(83) 1014-24",2005,"Falk","Ohl","F","Department of Urology, Charité-Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Campus Mitte, Schumannstrasse 20/21, 10098 Berlin, Germany. klaus.jung@charite.de"

The use of the uterine gland knockout (UGKO) ewe has demonstrated the critical role of epithelial secretions in regulation of conceptus survival and growth. A custom ovine cDNA array was used to identify alterations in gene expression of endometria from Day 14 cyclic, pregnant, and UGKO ewes (study 1) and from cyclic ewes treated with P4 or P4 with ZK 136,317 antiprogestin and control proteins or IFNT (study 2). In study 1, expression of 47 genes was more than 2-fold different between Day 14 pregnant and cyclic endometria, whereas 23 genes was different between Day 14 cyclic and UGKO endometria. In study 2, 70 genes were different due to P4 alone, 74 genes were affected by IFNT in a P4-dependent manner, and 180 genes were regulated by IFNT in a P4-independent manner. In each study, an approximately equal number of genes were found to be activated or repressed in each group. Endometrial genes increased by pregnancy and P4 and/or IFNT include B2M, CTSL, CXCL10, G1P3, GRP, IFI27, IFIT1, IFITM3, LGALS15, MX1, POSTN, RSAD2, and STAT5A. Transcripts decreased by pregnancy and P4 and/or IFNT include COL3A1, LUM, PTMA, PUM1, RPL9, SPARC, and VIM.

16299812,"Genistein affects androgen-responsive genes through both androgen- and estrogen-induced signaling pathways.","This study examined the mechanisms by which the prostate cancer chemopreventive agent genistein modulates gene expression in LNCaP human prostate cancer cells. Expression of androgen- and estrogen-regulated genes was measured in LNCaP cells cultured in the presence or absence of hormonal stimulation and the presence or absence of genistein. Genistein strongly suppressed basal expression of androgen-responsive gene (ARG) mRNAs, including prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and Ste20-related proline-alanine-rich kinase (SPAK). However, genistein had little or no effect on basal expression of two other ARGs, beta2-microglobulin (B2M) or selenoprotein P (SEPP1). Culturing LNCaP cells in the presence of the synthetic androgen R1881-induced increases in PSA, SPAK, B2M, and SEPP1 mRNA levels. The R1881-induced expression of these genes was uniformly blocked by genistein. For PSA and SPAK, genistein also blocked or downregulated 17beta-estradiol-induced increases in mRNA expression. These results indicate that genistein selectively alters expression of ARG mRNAs in LNCaP cells through modulation of both androgen- and estrogen-induced signaling pathways.","0899-1987","Molecular carcinogenesis","(45) 18-25",2006,"Yoko","Takahashi","Y","Phytonutrients Laboratory, Beltsville Human Nutrition Research Center, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Beltsville, Maryland 20705, USA."

Using specific small interference RNAs to knock down SMRT and/or N-CoR in LNCaP cells, we found that SMRT and N-CoR not only mediate antagonist-dependent inhibition of AR activation but also have a widespread role in suppressing agonist-dependent activation of several AR target genes we have tested, including PSA (prostate-specific antigen), TSC22 (TSC22 domain family member 1), NKX3-1 (NK3 transcription factor locus 1), and B2M(beta-2-microglobulin). By sequencing analysis followed by analysis of physical association by chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, we mapped the putative androgen response elements in the NKX3-1 and B2M. Consistent with a role in both antagonist- and agonist-regulated transcription by AR, chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that both SMRT and N-CoR were recruited by AR to these genes in the presence of either flutamide or R1881. Knocking down SMRT and N-CoR enhanced the recruitment of the coactivators steroid receptor coactivator 1 and p300 by agonist-bound AR and led to increased hyperacetylation of histone H3 and H4, suggesting that the corepressors actively compete with coactivators for binding to agonist-bound AR. Taken together, our data indicate that SMRT and N-CoR corepressors are involved in transcriptional regulation by both agonist- and antagonist-bound AR and regulate the magnitude of hormone response, at least in part, by competing with coactivators.","0888-8809","Molecular endocrinology (Baltimore, Md.)","(20) 1048-60",2006,"Ho-Geun","Yoon","HG","Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Center for Chronic Metabolic Disease Research, College of Medicine, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea."

There has been little research conducted to test if SuperScript III quantitative one-step (reverse transcription carried out in the same tube as PCR) and two-step (reverse transcription carried out in a separate reaction) RT-PCR systems provide similar real-time results. In this study, real-time reactions were set up using the housekeeping genes glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), beta2-microglobulin (B2M), and RNA polymerase 2 subunit A (PolR2A). Reaction efficiencies were determined by generating standard curves using total RNA isolated from human skeletal muscle and brain. Reaction efficiencies ranged from 97.7+/-0.9% to 99.4+/-1.8% for one-step and 98.0+/-0.2% to 102.6+/-1.3% for two-step RT-PCR (R2 values for all reactions>or=0.995). The sensitivities of one-step and two-step methods, as measured by cycle threshold values, were similar for GAPDH and B2M. However, for the lesser expressed PolR2A mRNA there was a 5 cycle lower threshold for one-step. In summary, both SuperScript III one-step and two-step methods yield reaction efficiencies close to 100% and produce similar, accurate, linear standard curves. However, using the one-step method with gene-specific priming may be more sensitive for quantification of certain genes such as PolR2A.","1524-0215","Journal of biomolecular techniques : JBT","(16) 266-71",2005,"Michael J","Wacker","MJ","Applied Physiology Laboratory, 5059 Haworth Hall, 1200 Sunnyside Ave, University of Kansas, Lawrence, KS 66045, USA. mjwacker@ku.edu"
16596194,"Differential expression of alternatively spliced mRNA forms of the insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor in human neuroendocrine tumors.","The activation of the insulin-like growth factor 1/IGF1 receptor system (IGF1/IGF1R) is a critical event in the transformation and tumorigenicity processes in a wide variety of human tumors. The IGF1/IGF1R system has been recently studied in carcinoid tumors that often arise in the gastrointestinal tract; these tumors are characterized by hypersecretion of bioamines and neuropeptides, leading to functional tumor disease. Two alternatively spliced IGF1R mRNA transcripts have been described to differ by only three nucleotides (CAG) in the coding sequence, resulting in an amino-acid change from the originally described Thr-Gly to an Arg in the extracellular portion of the receptor beta subunit. In transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells, the form without CAG (CAG-) exhibited an approximate 2-fold increase in IGF1 stimulation of activities required for its mitogenic properties. In this study, we examine the relative expression of the two IGF1R mRNA isoforms by a semiquantitative RT-PCR approach using highly standardized conditions, beta-2 microglobulin (B2M) as a reference gene and gel imaging analysis. We analyzed a large series of human neuroendocrine tumors (32 samples) and 9 normal tissues. A significant higher expression of both isoforms in the tumor samples (approximately 2-fold increase) was found, while a constant CAG+/CAG- IGF1R mRNA isoforms of an approximate 3:1 ratio was observed in all tumoral and normal cell types studied. The phylogenetic study of the IGF1R locus in several species suggests that human IGF1R CAG- mRNA isoform is evolutionarily more recent compared to the IGF1R CAG+ mRNA isoform and it could be used by the splicing apparatus at this intron/exon junction with a lower efficiency. This study highlights the relevance of IGF1R mRNA expression in neuroendocrine tumor cells, and the constant presence of 'subtle' alternative splicing for the IGF1R locus.","1021-335X","Oncology reports","(15) 1249-56",2006,"Lorenza","Vitale","L","Dipartimento di Istologia, Embriologia e Biologia Applicata, Università di Bologna, I-40126 Bologna, Italy."

Although knock-in of CBFB-MYH11 is not sufficient to cause disease, expression increases the incidence of leukemia when combined with cooperating events. Although mouse models are valuable tools in the study of leukemogenesis, little is known about the contribution of CBFbeta-SMMHC to human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell self-renewal. We introduced the CBFbeta-MYH11 cDNA into human CD34+ cells via retroviral transduction. Transduced cells displayed an initial repression of progenitor activity but eventually dominated the culture, resulting in the proliferation of clonal populations for up to 7 months. Long-term cultures displayed a myelomonocytic morphology while retaining multilineage progenitor activity and engraftment in NOD/SCID-B2M-/- mice. Progenitor cells from long-term cultures showed altered expression of genes defining inv(16) identified in microarray studies of human patient samples. This system will be useful in examining the effects of CBFbeta-SMMHC on gene expression in the human preleukemic cell, in characterizing the effect of this oncogene on human stem cell biology, and in defining its contribution to the development of leukemia.","0006-4971","Blood","(108) 1690-7",2006,"Mark","Wunderlich","M","Division of Experimental Hematology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, OH 45226, USA."

The biotransformation of PAHs to carcinogenic metabolites is mediated by the aromatic hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), which activates transcription at xenobiotic responsive elements (XREs = 5'-GCGTG-3') found in the promoter regions of genes encoding for detoxifying enzymes, including CYP1A1 and CYP1B1. In this study, we wished to identify novel biomarkers that may be useful in monitoring critical carcinogenic events of the breast induced by PAHs. Using a GeneMAP CancerArray, we analyzed in breast cancer MCF-7 cells the temporal effects of the AhR agonist benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P), which is a prototype PAH and known environmental carcinogen. Genes upregulated at least threefold by B[a]P and containing potential XREs within their promoter regions included CYP1A1, CYP1B1, paired box gene 3 (PAX3), cortactin (CTTN/EMS1), beta-2-microglobulin (B2M), and transferrin receptor (TfR). The stimulatory effects of B[a]P on expression of these genes were abrogated by cotreatment with the AhR antagonist flavonoid, alpha-napthoflavone (ANF). The TfR gene was selected for further analysis as its promoter region contains two potential XREs and its expression has been shown to be increased in breast cancer cells. Accumulation of TfR mRNA in B[a]P-treated cells was confirmed by quantitative real time PCR. Transient transfection studies indicated that the transcriptional activity of the TfR promoter was stimulated by B[a]P, whereas ANF counteracted this induction. These results indicate that the TfR gene may be a potential biomarker of PAH exposure.","0893-6692","Environmental and molecular mutagenesis","(47) 518-26",2006,"Michael Q","Kemp","MQ","Laboratory of Mammary Gland Biology, Department of Nutritional Sciences, University of Arizona, Tucson, Arizona 85721-0038, USA."

First, primers were optimized using mRNA from canine cell lines and from 30 tissues of one dog as template and SYBR green as fluorescent probe. Second, the expression variation and stability of a gene within one specific tissue were determined. Prostate, kidney, mammary gland, left ventricle, and liver tissues from five to nine dogs of different breeds, sexes, ages, body weights, and disease status were used. Averaging relative stabilities over these tissues revealed the usefulness of individual genes as reference genes. Furthermore, according to expression variation of a reference gene within a specific tissue, usually two to four reference genes are sufficient. Taken together, ribosomal protein S19 (RPS19), ribosomal protein S5 (RPS5), beta-2-microglobulin (B2M), and hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) are advocated.

Expression fingerprints obtained from biopsies with histological diagnosis of DN (n = 13) and from control subjects (pretransplant kidney donors [n = 7] and minimal change disease [n = 4]) allowed us to segregate the biopsies by disease state and stage by the specific expression signatures. Functional categorization showed regulation of genes linked to inflammation in progressive DN. Pathway mapping of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB), a master transcriptional switch in inflammation, segregated progressive from mild DN and control subjects by showing upregulation of 54 of 138 known NF-kappaB targets. The promoter regions of regulated NF-kappaB targets were analyzed using ModelInspector, and the NF-kappaB module NFKB_IRFF_01 was found to be specifically enriched in progressive disease. Using this module, the induction of eight NFKB_IRFF_01-dependant genes was correctly predicted in progressive DN (B2M, CCL5/RANTES, CXCL10/IP10, EDN1, HLA-A, HLA-B, IFNB1, and VCAM1).

17188656,"Validation of endogenous controls for quantitative gene expression analysis: application on brain cortices of human chronic alcoholics.","Real-time PCR is frequently used for gene expression quantification due to its methodological sensitivity and reproducibility. The gene expression is quantified by normalization to one or more reference genes, usually beta-actin (ACTB), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPD) or to ribosomal RNA (18S). However, different environmental or pathological conditions might also influence the expression of normalizing genes, which could severely skew the interpretation of quantitative results. This study evaluates whether 16 genes frequently used as endogenous controls in expression studies, can serve as such for comparison of human brain tissues of chronic alcoholics and control subjects. The prefrontal and motor cortices that are affected differently by chronic alcohol consumption were analyzed. The reference genes that have no or small differences in expression in alcoholics and control subjects, were found to be specific for each region: beta-actin (ACTB) and ribosomal large P0 (RPLP0) for the prefrontal cortex while importin 8 (IPO8) and RNA polymerase II (POLR2A) for the motor cortex. Four out of sixteen analyzed genes demonstrated significant differences in expression between alcoholics and controls: phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK1), hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl transferase (HPRT1) and peptidylprolyl isomerase A (PPIA) in the motor cortex and beta-2-microglobulin (B2M) in the prefrontal cortex.

17442853,"An impaired breeding phenotype in mice with a genetic deletion of beta-2 microglobulin and diminished MHC class I expression: role in reproductive fitness.","Beta-2 microglobulin (B2M) plays a pivotal role in the biology of mammals, including its association with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) Class I gene products. The latter molecules have been shown to affect reproduction in both mice and humans, although the exact mechanism is still unknown. Here we report the results of a longitudinal study of the reproductive performance of a genetically modified B2m deficient mouse strain with low MHC Class I expression. Our data show that this mouse strain has an impaired reproductive performance. However, the mice superovulate well and show a normal estrous cycle. Breeding studies from crosses between the transgenic mice and the wild-type parental strain show that B2m deficient mice have a significantly lower frequency of mating than the control B2m+/+ mice. In addition, the litter size and weaning success of B2m deficient mice were lower than the control. Perinatal lethality of the B2m deficient offspring was also inflicted by cannibalism of the young pups by the B2m deficient female. The impaired breeding phenotype (IBP) can be reversed by reintroducing the B2m gene in F1 heterozygous B2m+/- animals; thus the presence of B2M confers a normal breeding pattern. The acquisition of an impaired breeding phenotype (IBP) as a result of the knockout of B2m directly implicates B2M in the reproductive cycle of mice and raises the possibility of an effect of B2M on the reproduction of other mammals.","0006-3363","Biology of reproduction","(77) 274-9",2007,"Joanne C","Cooper","JC","Department of Experimental Biology, Huntingdon Life Sciences Ltd., Alconbury, Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire PE28 4HS, England."
17475929,"Pig conceptuses increase uterine interferon-regulatory factor 1 (IRF1), but restrict expression to stroma through estrogen-induced IRF2 in luminal epithelium.","Pig conceptuses secrete estrogen for pregnancy recognition, and they secrete interferons (IFNs) gamma and delta during the peri-implantation period. The uterine effects of pig IFNs are not known, although ruminant conceptuses secrete IFN tau for pregnancy recognition, and this increases the expression of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) in the endometrium. In sheep, the transcriptional repressor interferon-regulatory factor 2 (IRF2) is expressed in the endometrial luminal epithelium (LE) and appears to restrict IFN tau induction of most ISGs, including IRF1, to the stroma and glands. Interestingly, MX1, which is an ISG in sheep, is also expressed in the endometrial stroma of pregnant pigs. The objective of the present study was to determine if estrogen and/or conceptus secretory proteins (CSPs) that contain IFNs regulate IRF1 and IRF2 in pig endometria. The endometrial levels of IRF1 and IRF2 were low throughout the estrus cycle. After Day 12 of pregnancy, the levels of the classical ISGs, which include IRF1, STAT2, MIC, and B2M, increased in the overall endometrium, with expression of IRF1 and STAT2 being specifically localized to the stroma. IRF2 increased in the LE after Day 12. To determine the effects of estrogen, pigs were treated with 17 beta-estradiol benzoate (E2). To determine the CSP effects, pigs were treated with E2 and implanted with mini-osmotic pumps that delivered control serum proteins (CX) to one ligated uterine horn and CSP to the other horn. Estrogen increased the level of IRF2 in the endometrial LE. The administration of E2 and infusion of CSP increased the level of IRF1 in the stroma. These results suggest that conceptus estrogen induces IRF2 in the LE and limits the induction of IRF1 by conceptus IFNs to the stroma. The cell-specific expression of IRF1 and IRF2 in the pig endometrium highlights the complex and overlapping events that are associated with gene expression during the peri-implantation period, when pregnancy recognition signaling and uterine remodeling for implantation and placentation are necessary for successful pregnancy.","0006-3363","Biology of reproduction","(77) 292-302",2007,"Margaret M","Joyce","MM","Center for Animal Biotechnology and Genomics, Texas A&M University, College Station, Texas 77843-4458, USA."

17904413,"Evaluation and validation of housekeeping genes in response to ionizing radiation and chemical exposure for normalizing RNA expression in real-time PCR.","Gene expression changes are used with increasing frequency to assess the effects of exposure to environmental agents. Housekeeping (Hk) genes are essential in these analyses as internal controls for normalizing expression levels evaluated with Real-Time PCR (RT-PCR). Ideal Hk genes are constitutively expressed, do not respond to external stimuli and exhibit little or no sample-to-sample or run-to-run variation. Previous studies indicate that some commonly used Hk genes including glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and beta-actin have differential expression in various cell lines. Here we examine the expression of 11 Hk genes in four normal human lymphoblastoid cell lines and one T-cell leukemia (Jurkat) cell line following exposure to graded doses of ionizing radiation or to varying ratio concentrations of phytohemagglutinin (PHA) and phorbol myristate acetate (PMA). PHA and PMA are known to have synergistic effects on the expression of some genes and have very different effects from those of radiation. There has been no systematic study performed to ascertain the best control genes for radiation and/or PHA/PMA exposures in lymphoblastoid cells. Using a two-step reverse-transcriptase RT-PCR protocol we show that following radiation doses ranging from 0 to 400 cGy, 18S rRNA, acidic ribosomal protein, beta-actin, cyclophilin, GAPDH, phosphoglycerokinase, beta-2 microglobulin (B2M), beta-glucuronidase, hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase and transferrin receptor showed no significant variation in expression in normal lymphoblastoid cells. In contrast, only 18S rRNA levels were unchanged in Jurkat cells. After PHA/PMA treatment of the same normal cell lines, B2M showed no significant variation and 18S rRNA, GAPDH and transcription binding protein (TBP) were minimally responsive, whereas in Jurkat cells all these genes were unresponsive. While our results suggest that the utility of a particular Hk gene should be determined for each experimental condition, 18S rRNA and B2M appear to be excellent candidates for use as internal controls in RT-PCR in human lymphoblastoid cells because they have the most constant levels of expression across cell lines following exposure to ionizing radiation as well as to PHA/PMA.","0027-5107","Mutation research","(649) 126-34",2008,"Malathi","Banda","M","Department of Biological Sciences, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI 48202, USA."

The mRNA levels of two androgen receptor (AR) regulated genes, PSA and TSC22, decreased with allspice treatment (100 microg/ml). Importantly, in IP western analysis, AR acetylation was dramatically decreased by allspice treatment.Furthermore, chromatin immunoprecipitation indicated that the acetylation of histone H3 in the PSA and B2M promoter regions was also repressed. Finally, allspice treatment reduced the growth of human prostate cancer cells, LNCaP (50% growth inhibition at 200 microg/ml). Taken together, our data indicate that the potent HAT inhibitory activity of allspice reduced AR and histone acetylation and led to decreased transcription of AR target genes, resulting in inhibition of prostate cancer cell growth.","1347-6947","Bioscience, biotechnology, and biochemistry","(71) 2712-9",2007,"Yoo-Hyun","Lee","YH","Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Center for Chronic Metabolic Disease Research, College of Medicine, Yonsei University."

The aim of this study was to define pretransplantation factors that influence outcomes following autoHSCT in patients with MM. Eighty-one MM patients, aged 51 years (range 31-70 years), undergoing first autoHSCT were included in the analysis. Thirty patients were in complete remission and 51 were in partial remission. The conditioning regimen was based mainly on melphalan (200 mg/m(2) intravenous [iv]). The following factors were tested for their prognostic significance: beta-2-microglobulin (B2M), lactate dehydrogenase, monoclonal protein level, bone marrow plasma cell percentage (PL), hemoglobin level, age, interval from diagnosis to autoHSCT, and number of transplanted CD34-positive cells. The transplant-related mortality at day 100 was 3.7% (3/81). The incidence of progression at 9.2 years was 71% for patients with elevated B2M, and 32% for those where B2M was within normal limits (P = .02.) The probability of PFS was decreased for patients with B2M > or = versus < normal limits (29% vs 68%; P = .02) and PL > or = versus < 5% (0% vs 45%; P = 0.03). In a multivariate analysis B2M remained the only factor associated with increased risk of progression (relative risk [RR] = 3.3; P = .03) and reduced probability of PFS (RR = 3.3; P = .03).

18094763,"A microfluidic processor for gene expression profiling of single human embryonic stem cells.","The gene expression of human embryonic stem cells (hESC) is a critical aspect for understanding the normal and pathological development of human cells and tissues. Current bulk gene expression assays rely on RNA extracted from cell and tissue samples with various degree of cellular heterogeneity. These 'cell population averaging' data are difficult to interpret, especially for the purpose of understanding the regulatory relationship of genes in the earliest phases of development and differentiation of individual cells. Here, we report a microfluidic approach that can extract total mRNA from individual single-cells and synthesize cDNA on the same device with high mRNA-to-cDNA efficiency. This feature makes large-scale single-cell gene expression profiling possible. Using this microfluidic device, we measured the absolute numbers of mRNA molecules of three genes (B2M, Nodal and Fzd4) in a single hESC. Our results indicate that gene expression data measured from cDNA of a cell population is not a good representation of the expression levels in individual single cells. Within the G0/G1 phase pluripotent hESC population, some individual cells did not express all of the 3 interrogated genes in detectable levels. Consequently, the relative expression levels, which are broadly used in gene expression studies, are very different between measurements from population cDNA and single-cell cDNA. The results underscore the importance of discrete single-cell analysis, and the advantages of a microfluidic approach in stem cell gene expression studies.","1473-0197","Lab on a chip","(8) 68-74",2008,"Jiang F","Zhong","JF","Department of Neurology, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA 90033, USA. jzhong@usc.edu"

To determine whether molecular markers might be prognostic for lymph node metastases, we measured by quantitative real-time RT-PCR the expression levels of 15 cancer-associated genes in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded primary tissues derived from stage I-IV CRC patients with (n=20) and without (n=18) nodal metastases. Using the mean of the 15 genes as an internal reference control, we observed that low expression of beta(2)microglobulin (B2M) was a strong prognostic indicator of lymph node metastases (area under the curve (AUC)=0.85; 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.69-0.94). We also observed that the expression ratio of B2M/Spint2 had the highest prognostic accuracy (AUC=0.87; 95% CI=0.71-0.96) of all potential two-gene combinations. Expression values of Spint2 correlated with the mean of the entire gene set at an R(2) value of 0.97, providing evidence that Spint2 serves not as an independent prognostic gene, but rather as a reliable reference control gene. These studies are the first to demonstrate a prognostic role of B2M at the mRNA level and suggest that low B2M expression levels might be useful for identifying patients with lymph node metastasis and/or poor survival.","1532-1827","British journal of cancer","(98) 1999-2005",2008,"J","Shrout","J","College of Health Professions-Cytology and Biosciences, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC 29425, USA."

Our recent case-control association study of 268 SNPs in 121 candidate genes identified alpha-synuclein (SNCA) as a susceptibility gene for sporadic PD (P = 1.7 x 10(-11)). We also replicated the association of fibroblast growth factor 20 (FGF20) with PD (P = 0.0089). To find other susceptibility genes, we added 34 SNPs to the previous screen. Of 302 SNPs in a total 137 genes, but excluding SNCA, SNPs in NDUFV2, FGF2, CALB1 and B2M showed significant association (P < 0.01; 882 cases and 938 control subjects). We replicated the association analysis for these SNPs in a second independent sample set (521 cases and 1,003 control subjects). One SNP, rs1805874 in calbindin 1 (CALB1), showed significance in both analyses (P = 7.1 x 10(-5); recessive model). When the analysis was stratified relative to the SNCA genotype, the odds ratio of CALB1 tended to increase according to the number of protective alleles in SNCA. In contrast, FGF20 was significant only in the subgroup of SNCA homozygote of risk allele. CALB1 is a calcium-binding protein that widely is expressed in neurons. A relative sparing of CALB1-positive dopaminergic neurons is observed in PD brains, compared with CALB1-negative neurons. Our genetic analysis suggests that CALB1 is associated with PD independently of SNCA, and that FGF20 is associated with PD synergistically with SNCA.","1432-1203","Human genetics","(124) 89-94",2008,"Ikuko","Mizuta","I","Division of Clinical Genetics, Department of Medical Genetics, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, 2-2-B9 Yamadaoka, Suita, Osaka, 565-0871, Japan."

This can be achieved by normalization with control genes. The study was designed to identify candidates not altered after brain trauma. Male C57Bl/6 mice were anesthetized with isoflurane, and a pneumatic brain trauma was induced by controlled cortical impact (CCI) on the right parietal cortex. Brains were removed at 15 min, and 3, 6, 12 and 24 h after CCI and from naive animals (n = 6 each). Absolute copies of six control genes (beta-2-microglobin [B2M], cyclophilin A, beta-actin, hypoxanthine ribosyltransferase [HPRT], porphobilinogen deaminase [PBGD], and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase [GAPDH]) and one example target gene (iNOS) were determined by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR; Lightcycler) in the traumatic focus and contralateral tissue. Control gene expression was stable until 12 h after CCI. At 24 h after CCI expression of B2M, cyclophilin A and HPRT remained stable in the contusion, while expression of beta-actin, GAPDH, and PBGD increased. Due to variations between animals (+/-85%), increases in beta-actin (+64%) and GAPDH (+59%) did not reach the level of significance. In non-contused tissue, expression of all genes dropped 24 h after CCI (range, -17% to -61%). Due to low variations between animals and stable expression after CCI, B2M and cyclophilin A seem to be suitable to serve as single normalizer. Normalization of the example target gene iNOS resulted in varying relative expression extending from onefold (PBDG) to 10-fold (HPRT).

However, there are several complexities built into the assay that can affect data interpretation. Most notably, the selection of an appropriate internal control for normalization is essential for expression data interpretation. In this study we investigated the suitability of seven commonly used genes [18S ribosomal RNA (18S), alpha tubulin (TUBA), beta actin (ACTB), beta-2 microglobulin (B2M), embryonic elongation factor-1 alpha (EEF1A), glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), and RNA polymerase II polypeptide B (POLR2B)] as potential quantitative references for normalizing real-time PCR data generated in the study of channel catfish physiology. Gene expression and stability were evaluated among 15 channel catfish tissues and within physiologically-relevant tissues in response to experimental manipulation (i.e. LHRH injection, fasting, and acute stress). Expression of the seven candidate reference genes varied across all tissue types tested, indicating that none of the genes could suitably serve as reference genes for cross tissue comparisons. Experimentally altering the physiological state of the fish differentially affected expression of the various reference genes depending on experimental design and tissue type, with 18S unaffected by the experimental treatment in all tissues examined. For example, the selection of a differentially expressed gene, GAPDH, as opposed to 18S, to normalize hepatic growth hormone receptor during fasting resulted in misinterpretation of the data.

Mass spectrometric analysis of peritonitis PDE samples identified the 11,117.4 protein as beta2-microglobulin (B2M). Using an unbiased protein profiling approach, we have validated previously reported findings of B2M as a biomarker associated with CAPD peritonitis. Prospective studies are warranted to establish additional biomarkers that would be predictive of peritoneal dialysis peritonitis.

Forty-six consecutive, routinely performed, FNAB of thyroid nodules were evaluated for the feasibility of applying RT-PCR method. RNA was extracted from 1 of 3 fresh residual samples and analyzed to determine its pureness, integrity, and concentration. Cellularity was adequate in all 46, except one, specimens analyzed, scored as 0, 1+, 2+, 3+, and 4+ in 1, 10, 14, 9, and 8 cases, respectively. Thirty-three nodules measured less than 1.5 cm. Cytological diagnosis was positive for malignancy in 3 cases, indeterminate for malignancy in 3, most probably benign follicular lesion in 7, negative for malignancy in 32, and suggestive of benign follicular lesion in 1. Good quality RNA was successfully isolated in 45/46 (97.8%) samples, with an average RNA concentration of 14 ng/microl and detection of B2M mRNA in 97.7% (44/45). There was no significant correlation between RNA concentration and nodule size or specimen cellularity. In conclusion, molecular analysis using individual, residual samples of thyroid nodules aspirates is feasible and could be employed for molecular preoperative studies in the future, adding elements for final cytological diagnosis of indeterminate cases, without altering the routine procedure.","1097-0339","Diagnostic cytopathology","(36) 899-903",2008,"Cristina Aparecida Troques da Silveira","Mitteldorf","CA","Laboratory of Surgical and Molecular Pathology, Hospital Sírio Libanês, rua Dona Adma Jafet 91, São Paulo, Brazil. crismitteldorf@ig.com.br"

The development of prognostic models in WM has been fraught by limited follow-up in current studies. Here, we update the outcome of a prospective WM trial with a median follow-up of 10 years for live patients. Of the 59 previously untreated patients who initially were observed, only 12 patients (21%) required therapy at a median follow-up of 100 months. Multivariate analysis among the 183 patients requiring therapy reaffirmed age 70 years or greater, previous nonprotocol therapy, and beta-2 microglobulin (B2M) of 3 mg/dL or greater as prognostic factors. Importantly, increased serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was identified as an additional independent variable, which improved risk assessment beyond the recent WM international prognostic scoring system (ISSWM). By using age, previous therapy, B2M, and LDH, we identified 3 risk groups with 8-year survival estimates of 55%, 33%, and 5% (P < .001). These data provide novel insights into factors predicting long-term outcome in WM.

19012427,"Temporal stability of the urinary proteome after kidney transplant: more sensitive than protein composition?","The temporal urinary proteome was examined in 4 groups of individuals in order to determine the temporal stability of diverse individuals with apparently good kidney health. The groups consisted of (1) healthy volunteers at zero time, 1 and 6 months, (2) kidney donors before and after surgery, (3) recipients immediately after surgery, and (4) successful kidney transplant recipients from 1 month to 4 years after transplant. Proteins were detected by reverse phase extraction of urine followed by MALDI-TOF profile and by iTRAQ analysis. Unusual components of the MALDI-TOF profiles found only in transplant subjects occurred at m/ z = 3370, 3441 and 3385 (human neutrophil defensins), 4303, 10350, and 11732 (beta-2 microglobulin, B2M). The peaks at m/ z = 4303 and 11732 were also quite intense among kidney donors following surgery. The peaks at m/ z = 4303 and 10350 in transplant recipients were associated with higher serum creatinine. Several additional proteins detected by iTRAQ were up-regulated in a manner that correlated closely with B2M. Overall, despite large differences between protein composition in different transplant recipients, there was remarkable stability for each individual as detected by either MALDI-TOF or iTRAQ analyses. These results suggested that, within limits, stability of profile components may be as important as protein content for definition of kidney health. Longitudinal study of urinary proteins from kidney recipients may demonstrate instability as a sensitive biomarker of adverse kidney health.","1535-3893","Journal of proteome research","(8) 94-103",2009,"Sanjeev K","Akkina","SK","Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55455, USA."

Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer was used to check the RNA quality. To validate the results from 2100 bioanalyzer, RT-PCR was performed with six genes at both 5'and 3' end-regions of different abundance (EF1A and ATCB of high abundance, GAPDH and B2M of moderate abundance, and MED1 and CK20 of low abundance). RT-PCR analysis of 3 good quality RNAs from cultured cell lines and 3 poor quality RNAs from gastric noncancerous tissues showed high correlations with that from 2100 bioanalyzer. In conclusion, the pipeline for low amount RNA quality assessment by RT-PCR from tissue cryo-section, pathological recheck, LCM purification and RNA isolation is applicable as a routine method in cancer genome research.","0253-9772","Yi chuan = Hereditas","(30) 1521-6",2008,"Yan-Qing","Yang","YQ","State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics and Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200025, China. yanqing_yang@shbiochip.com"
19083749,"Real-time PCR detection of five different ""endogenous control gene"" transcripts in forensic autopsy material.","Relative quantification of mRNA using quantitative real-time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR is a commonly used method for analysis and comparison of gene expression levels. This method requires a normalisation of data against expression levels of a control gene. In the past, several ubiquitously expressed genes were used as such endogenous controls. When working with human tissue samples obtained during autopsy one has to deal with postmortem intervals of usually more than 10 h. The aim of this study was to investigate whether commonly used endogenous control genes show stability over various postmortem intervals. For this purpose, RNA was extracted from three different human tissues of five postmortem intervals ranging from 15 to 118 h. The Ct values from five commonly used endogenous control genes--beta-actin, B2M, CyPA, TBP, and UBC--were obtained by real-time RT-PCR. Results revealed a relatively high stability of Ct values in skeletal muscle tissue regarding different postmortem intervals. In heart and brain tissues, all endogenous controls were found to be highly variable. B2M appeared to be the least unstable control in this set. Nevertheless, all endogenous controls showed variability in their expression levels regarding both the stability among different tissues and different postmortem intervals. Data obtained in the present study show that postmortem mRNA degradation is a complex process, and that the use of one single endogenous control in gene expression studies of postmortem tissue would lead to erroneous data interpretation. Further studies on this topic should be performed in the future including an increased number of well documented samples.","1878-0326","Forensic science international.

Therefore, evaluation of the stability of reference genes must be performed for each new tissue and species under study. The stability of B2M, GAPDH, HPRT, SRPR, hnRNPH, GUSB, RPL8, RPS5, and RPS19 was analyzed with the GeNorm software in snap frozen canine skin biopsies. Healthy dogs (n=7) and dogs with confirmed atopic dermatitis (n=28) were included. Lesional and non-lesional skin was analyzed. The study indicated that the most appropriate reference genes in canine skin are the ribosomal gene products RPL8, RPS5 and RPS19 besides GUSB and HPRT.

The median PFS and OS were 15.6 and 50.8 months, respectively. The median OS from diagnosis was 60 months. Traditional pre and post transplant prognostic variables earlier examined in Caucasian Americans (CA), including beta-2 microglobulin (B2M), chromosome 13 deletion, CR status after auto-SCT, gender, stage, Ig subtype, time to transplant, number of prior regimens and presence of lytic lesions, were not predictive of improved PFS or OS on univariate analysis. Age, lower CD34 cell dose infused, history of palliative radiation therapy (XRT) prior to auto-SCT and refractory disease at the time of auto-SCT were predictive of inferior PFS. History of palliative XRT was the only predictive factor of inferior PFS and OS after auto-SCT on multivariate analysis. In conclusion, MM in AA tends to relapse early after auto-SCT. It is unclear whether early relapses impact OS.

Thirty-two Wistar rats were randomized into four groups (n = 8) as follows: control (sham laparotomy), renal I/R (60-min left renal ischemia and 120-min reperfusion), renal I/R + iloprost (20 ng kg(-1) min(-1) infusion during renal I/R period, i.v.), and control + iloprost. Blood and kidney tissue samples were obtained for biochemical and histological analysis from all rats. Serum urea, creatinine, CyC, and B2M levels were evaluated for biochemical analysis. Histopathological changes in renal structure were examined for histological analysis. Serum urea, creatinine, and CyC levels were significantly increased in the renal I/R group. Iloprost treatment decreased these three markers in the renal I/R + iloprost group. beta2-Microglobulin levels were not significantly changed in any group. Histological analyses showed that renal I/R elicited significant renal injury, whereas iloprost significantly decreased I/R-induced renal injury. Serum CyC level is one of the good indicators of acute renal damage due to I/R produced by renal artery occlusion. In contrast, we have shown that there are no significant changes in the levels of serum B2M levels that would make it an accurate diagnostic tool for detecting acute changes in renal injury subject to renal I/R in rats.","1540-0514","Shock (Augusta, Ga.)","(32) 498-502",2009,"M Orkun","Sahsivar","MO","Department of Cardiovascular Surgery, Meram Medical School, Selcuk University, Konya, Turkey."

However, B2M levels are heavily influenced by the patient's glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and this study aimed to evaluate whether GFR-adjusted B2M (GFR-B2M) had improved prognostic value compared to unadjusted B2M in a cohort of over 450 consecutive CLL patients from two separate institutions. Multivariate analysis identified a significantly shorter TFS in patients who were ZAP-70 + (P < 0.001), with increased GFR-B2M (P < 0.001), and del(11q) or del(17p) as detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH; P < 0.001). When OS was evaluated by multivariate analysis, age 65 years or older (P < 0.001) and poor risk FISH abnormalities (P < 0.001) had a confirmed adverse prognostic impact, but the predictive value of GFR-B2M was lost in the validation analysis. In all survival models, B2M did not attain independent significance unless GFR-B2M was eliminated from the analysis. In conclusion, GFR-B2M is a better predictor of TFS than unadjusted B2M in CLL patients.","1365-2141","British journal of haematology","(145) 801-5",2009,"Julio","Delgado","J","Department of Haematology, Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau, Barcelona, Spain. jdelgadog@santpau.cat"
19389958,"Identification of internal control genes for quantitative polymerase chain reaction in mammary tissue of lactating cows receiving lipid supplements.","Dietary lipid supplements affect mammary lipid metabolism partly through changes in lipogenic gene expression. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) is a sensitive, reliable, and accurate technique for gene expression analysis. However, variation introduced in qPCR data by analytical or technical errors needs to be accounted for via normalization using appropriate internal control genes (ICG). Objectives were to mine individual bovine mammary microarray data on >13,000 genes across 66 cows from 2 independent studies to identify the most suitable ICG for qPCR normalization. In addition to unsupplemented control diets, cows were fed saturated or unsaturated lipids for 21 d or were infused with supplements (butterfat, conjugated linoleic acid mixture, long-chain fatty acids) into the abomasum to modify milk fat synthesis and fatty acid profiles. We identified 49 genes that did not vary in expression across the 66 samples. Subsequent gene network analysis revealed that 22 of those genes were not co-regulated. Among those COPS7A, CORO1B, DNAJC19, EIF3K, EMD, GOLGA5, MTG1, UXT, MRPL39, GPR175, and MARVELD1 (sample/reference expression ratio = 1 +/- 0.1) were selected for PCR analysis upon verification of goodness of BLAT/BLAST sequence and primer design. Relative expression of B2M, GAPDH, and ACTB, previously used as ICG in bovine mammary tissue, was highly variable (0.9 +/- 0.6) across studies. Gene stability analysis via geNorm software uncovered MRPL39, GPR175, UXT, and EIF3K as having the most stable expression ratio and, thus, suitable as ICG. Analysis also indicated that use of 3 ICG was most appropriate for calculating a normalization factor. Overall, the geometric average of MRPL39, UXT, and EIF3K is ideal for normalization of mammary qPCR data in studies involving lipid supplementation of dairy cows. These novel ICG could be used for normalization in similar studies as alternatives to the less-reliable ACTB, GAPDH, or B2M.","1525-3198","Journal of dairy science","(92) 2007-19",2009,"A K G","Kadegowda","AK","Department of Animal and Avian Sciences, University of Maryland, College Park 20742, USA."

This study aimed to identify genes that may serve as reference in postmortem dorsolateral-prefrontal cortices (Brodmann's area 46) of schizophrenics, bipolar disorder (BPD) patients, and control subjects. In the exploratory stage of the analysis, samples of four BPD patients, two schizophrenics, and two controls were quantified using the TaqMan Low Density Array endogenous control panel, containing assays for 16 commonly used reference genes. In the next stage, six of these genes (TFRC, RPLP0, ACTB, POLR2a, B2M, and GAPDH) were quantified by qPCR in 12 samples of each clinical group. Expressional stability of the genes was determined by GeNorm and NormFinder. TFRC and RPLP0 were the most stably expressed genes, whereas the commonly used 18S, POLR2a, and GAPDH were the least stable.

Biomarkers of susceptibility indicate individuals with increased sensitivity of target molecules or metabolism causing increased target dose. The three categories of biomarkers were used in studies of health effects of metal exposures in China. Adverse effects on the kidney tubules with increased levels of the effect biomarkers beta-2-microglobulin in urine (UB2M) and urinary N-acetyl-beta-d-glucosaminidase (UNAG) were found among Cd exposed population groups in China. Among persons exposed to Cd, occupationally or in the general environment, the level of Cd-induced metallothionein mRNA (MTmRNA) in peripheral lymphocytes appeared as a useful indicator of the ability of individuals to synthesize MT. Persons with low MTmRNA levels displayed higher biomarker values of renal tubular damage than persons with high levels of MTmRNA, at comparable levels of urinary Cd. Other studies demonstrated the importance of auto-antibodies against metallothionein in plasma (MTab) in modifying the response to Cd. Persons with high levels of MTab displayed tubular proteinuria at lower levels of urinary Cd than persons with low levels of MTab. Studies in two metal contaminated areas in China demonstrated clear interactions between Cd and inorganic arsenic. Combined exposure, with increased levels of As and Cd in urine, caused considerably higher biomarker values of renal tubular damage, measured as increased urinary levels of B2M or NAG, than each of the exposures alone.","1879-3169","Toxicology letters","(192) 45-9",2010,"Gunnar F","Nordberg","GF","Environmental Medicine, Department of Public Health and Clinical Medicine, Umea University, SE-90187 Umea, Sweden.

Selection of an appropriate reference gene (RG) or an RG panel, which varies depending on cancer type, molecular subtypes, and the normal tissues used for interindividual calibration, is crucial for the accurate quantification of gene expression. Several RG panels have been suggested in breast cancer for making comparisons among tumor subtypes, cell lines, and benign/malignant tumors. In this study, expression patterns of 15 widely used endogenous RGs (ACTB, TBP, GAPDH, SDHA, HPRT, HMBS, B2M, PPIA, GUSB, YWHAZ2, PGK1, RPLP0, PUM1, MRPL19, and RPL41), and three candidate genes that were selected through analysis of two independent microarray datasets (IL22RA1, TC22, ZNF224) were determined in 23 primary breast tumors and their matched normal tissues using qRT-PCR. Additionally, 18S rRNA, ACTB, and SDHA were tested using randomly primed cDNAs from 13 breast tumor pairs to assess the rRNA/mRNA ratio. The tumors exhibited significantly lower rRNA/mRNA ratio when compared to their normals, on average. The expression of the studied RGs in breast tumors did not exhibit differences in terms of grade, ER, or PR status. The stability of RGs was examined based on two different statistical models, namely GeNorm and NormFinder. Among the 18 tested endogenous reference genes, ACTB and SDHA were identified as the most suitable reference genes for the normalization of qRT-PCR data in the analysis of normal matched tumor breast tissue pairs by both programs. In addition, the expression of the gelsolin (GSN) gene, a well-known downregulated target in breast tumors, was analyzed using the two most suitable genes and different RG combinations to validate their effectiveness as a normalization factor (NF). The GSN expression of the tumors used in this study was significantly lower than that of normals showing the effectivity of using ACTB and SDHA as suitable RGs in this set of tumor-normal tissue panel. The combinational use of the best performing two RGs (ACTB and SDHA) as a normalization factor can be recommended to minimize sample variability and to increase the accuracy and resolution of gene expression normalization in tumor-normal paired breast cancer qRT-PCR studies.","0965-0407","Oncology research","(17) 353-65",2009,"Bala","Gur-Dedeoglu","B","Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics, Faculty of Science, Bilkent University, Ankara, Turkey."

Fifty-nine advanced HNSCC patients were recruited for the study. The tumor expression of TAK1 mRNA was analyzed with RT-PCR using Taqman technology and its relationship with the clinical outcome of the patients studied. TAK1 mRNA expression was lower in patients that relapsed than in those that did not, but the difference was only significant between the patients that showed response to treatment (p < 0.001).

Attention has, thus, focused on enhancing solute removal via prolonged HD sessions. A reduction in the serum levels of phosphorus and beta-2-microglobulin (B2M) with longer HD treatments has been linked to improved patient outcomes. We have shown that serum phosphorus levels are significantly lowered in patients maintained on thrice-weekly, in-center, 8-hour nocturnal HD performed at a blood flow rate of 400 mL/min. The kinetics of this modality were examined. A total of 8 patients participated in the study (age 45+/-7 years). Serum creatinine levels decreased from 9.2+/-1.9 to 3.0+/-1.0 mg/dL at 8 hours while serum phosphorus decreased from 5.7+/-1.9 to 2.5+/-0.7 mg/dL at 8 hours. The initial decrease from predialysis values to 1 hour after the start of HD was significant for both creatinine (P<0.0001) and phosphorus (P<0.001). Serum B2M decreased from 26.8+/-5.5 mg/L predialysis to 14.9+/-7.0 mg/L at 8 hours (P<0.01). Dialysate-side clearances of phosphorus and creatinine were 136+/-13 and 143+/-27 cm(3)/min, respectively. Phosphorus clearances were steadily maintained during the 8-hour session. A total of 904+/-292 mg of phosphorus was removed during the 8-hour treatment, with 501+/-174 mg (55%) removed during the first 4 hours and the remaining 45% continuously removed during the latter one-half of the session. The overall calculated B2M clearance was 55.1+/-40.3 cm(3)/min using the immediate post-B2M value and 28.4+/-34.2 mg/L using the 30-minute postdialysis value for the calculation. Serum levels of phosphorus and B2M decrease dramatically during an 8-hour session.

Pig conceptuses release estrogens for pregnancy recognition, but also secrete IFNs that do not appear to be antiluteolytic. Estrogens and IFNs induce expression of largely non-overlapping sets of genes, and evidence suggests that pig conceptuses orchestrate essential events of early pregnancy including pregnancy recognition signaling, implantation and secretion of histotroph by precisely controlling temporal and spatial (cell-specific) changes in uterine gene expression through initial secretion of estrogens, followed by cytokines including IFNG and IFND. By Day 12 of pregnancy, estrogens increase the expression of multiple genes in the uterine luminal epithelium including SPP1, STC1, IRF2 and STAT1 that likely have roles for implantation. By Day 15 of pregnancy, IFNs upregulate a large array of IFN responsive genes in the underlying stroma and glandular epithelium including ISG15, IRF1, STAT1, SLAs and B2M that likely have roles in uterine remodeling to support placentation.","1747-3403","Society of Reproduction and Fertility supplement","(66) 321-32",2009,"G A","Johnson","GA","Department of Veterinary Integrative Biosciences, College of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX 77843-4458, USA. gjohnson@cvm.tamu.edu"
19899131,"Idiotype-pulsed antigen-presenting cells following autologous transplantation for multiple myeloma may be associated with prolonged survival.","Vaccines are attractive as consolidation therapy after autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) for multiple myeloma (MM). We report the results of a phase II trial of the immunotherapeutic, APC8020 (Mylovenge), given after ASCT for MM. We compared the results with that of other patients with MM who underwent ASCT at Mayo Clinic during the same time period. Twenty-seven patients were enrolled on the trial between July, 1998 and June, 2001, and the outcomes were compared to that of 124 consecutive patients transplanted during the same period, but not enrolled on the trial. The median (range) follow-up for patients still alive from the vaccine trial is 6.5 (2.9-8 years), and 7.1 (6-8 years) in the control group. The median age was 57.4 range (36.1-71.3) in the DB group and 56.4 (range, 30-69) in the trial group. Known prognostic factors including PCLI, B2M, and CRP were comparable between the groups. The median overall survival for the trial patients was 5.3 years (95% CI: 4.0 years-N/A) compared to 3.4 years (95% CI: 2.7-4.6 years) for the DB group (P = 0.02). The median time to progression and progression-free survival for the trial group was similar to the DB group. Although not a controlled trial, the vaccines given after ASCT appear to be associated with improved overall survival compared to historical controls. This approach warrants further investigation to confirm this and define the role of vaccine therapy in myeloma.","1096-8652","American journal of hematology","(84) 799-802",2009,"Martha Q","Lacy","MQ","Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, 200 First Street SW, Rochester, MN 55905, USA. lacy.martha@mayo.edu"
20036209,"Normalizing genes for real-time polymerase chain reaction in epithelial and nonepithelial cells of mouse small intestine.","Gene expression studies in intestinal epithelial and stromal cells are a common tool for investigating the mechanisms by which the homeostasis of the small intestine is regulated under normal and pathological conditions. Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) is a sensitive and highly reproducible method of gene expression analysis, with expression levels quantified by normalization against reference genes in most cases. However, the lack of suitable reference genes for epithelial cells with different differentiation states and nonepithelial tissue cells has limited the application of qPCR in gene expression studies of small intestinal samples. In this study, 13 housekeeping genes, ACTB, B2M, GAPDH, GUSB, HPRT1, HMBS, HSP90AB1, RPL13A, RPS29, RPLP0,PPIA, TBP, and TUBA1, were analyzed to determine their applicability for isolated crypt cells, villus cells, deepithelialized mucosa, and whole mucosa of the mouse small intestine. Using geNorm and NormFinder software, GUSB and TBP were identified as the most stably expressed genes, whereas the expressions of the commonly used reference genes GAPDH, B2M, and ACTB, and ribosomal protein genes RPL13A, RPS29, and RPLP0 were relatively unstable. Thus, this study demonstrates that GUSB and TBP are the optimal reference genes for the normalization of gene expression in the mouse small intestine.","1096-0309","Analytical biochemistry","(399) 211-7",2010,"Fengchao","Wang","F","Institute of Combined Injury, State Key Laboratory of Trauma, Burns and Combined Injury, College of Preventive Medicine, Third Military Medical University, 30 Gaotanyan Road, Shapingba District, Chongqing 400038, China."

20339955,"Reference gene selection for real-time RT-PCR in eight kinds of rat regenerating hepatic cells.","Liver regeneration (LR) is a process during which the liver recovers its mass and function after damage due to various causes such as partial hepatectomy (PH). It involves a sequence of well-orchestrated changes in physiological and biochemical activities, especially in the gene expression profile in a variety of liver cells. In order to produce reliable gene expression of target genes in eight kinds of rat hepatic cells during LR, the determination of internal control housekeeping genes (HKGs) is required. Eight kinds of hepatic cells were first isolated from liver tissue with high purity and activity. Then quantitative real-time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR was applied to detect expression changes of six commonly used HKGs (18SrRNA, B2M, ACTB, UBC, GAPDH, and HK1) in eight types of hepatic cells isolated from regenerating liver at 0, 2, 6, 12, 24, 30, 36, 72, 120, and 168 h after PH. The amplification of the HKGs was statistically analyzed by using geNorm algorithm. Using this method, 18SrRNA-UBC, ACTB-HK1, ACTB-GADPH, B2M-ACTB, 18SrRNA-UBC, B2M-UBC, B2M-ACTB, and B2M-UBC were found to be the two most stable reference genes for rat regenerating hepatocytes, hepatic stellate cells, Kupffer cells, biliary epithelial cells, sinusoidal endothelial cells, pit cells, dendritic cells, and oval cells, respectively, regardless of the stages of LR. In conclusion, this study has laid a good foundation for investigating gene expression of target genes in different types of hepatic cells during LR.","1559-0305","Molecular biotechnology","(46) 49-57",2010,"Gai-Ping","Wang","GP","College of Life Science, Henan Normal University, No. 46 Jianshe East Road, Xinxiang, Henan Province, China. xiaowang0529@163.com"
20362333,"Circulating Ki-67 index in plasma as a biomarker and prognostic indicator in chronic lymphocytic leukemia.","Ki-67 is a nuclear antigen that is expressed in all stages of the cell cycle, except G(0), and is widely used as a marker of cellular proliferation in human tumors. We recently showed that elevated levels of Ki-67 circulating in plasma (cKi-67) are associated with shorter survival in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The current study included 194 patients with CLL and 96 healthy control subjects. cKi-67 levels in plasma were determined using an electrochemiluminescent immunoassay. We normalized the cKi-67 level to the absolute number of lymphocytes in the patient's peripheral blood to establish the plasma cKi-67 index. The cKi-67 index showed significant correlation with lymph node involvement and Rai stage (P=0.05). Higher cKi-67 index values were significantly associated with shorter survival. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis demonstrated that the association of the cKi-67 index with shorter survival was independent of IgV(H) mutation status. In a multivariate model incorporating the cKi-67 index with B2M and IgV(H), only cKi-67 index and B2M levels remained as independent predictors of survival. The results of this study suggest that the plasma cKi-67 index, along with B2M level, is a strong predictor of clinical behavior in CLL.","1873-5835","Leukemia research","(34) 1320-4",2010,"Jean-Marie","Bruey","JM","Department of Hematology and Oncology R&D, Quest Diagnostics Nichols Institute, 33608 Ortega Highway, San Juan Capistrano, CA 92690, USA."

Expression stability of seven commonly used reference genes was examined in n=60 pigs from three independent populations of different genetic backgrounds. The genes examined were: ACTB, ATP5G1, B2M, GPX1, RPL4, TBP and YWHAZ. GeNorm analysis of expression stability identified B2M, RPL4 and TBP as consistently stable in each breed examined. Analysis of meat samples divergent for water holding capacity identified positive and negative associations between drip loss and gene expression using B2M, RPL4 and TBP as endogenous controls. Specifically, expression of COL1A1 increased significantly with increasing drip loss while expression of CAST decreased significantly with increasing drip loss. This study therefore indicates the use of B2M, RPL4 and TBP as suitable endogenous controls for gene expression analysis of the porcine LTL muscle. Further study is recommended to identify the detailed roles of COL1A1 and CAST with respect to the development of drip loss.","1873-4138","Meat science","(86) 436-9",2010,"Jean","McBryan","J","Teagasc Ashtown Food Research Centre, Ashtown, Dublin 15, Ireland."

However, no suitable reference genes have been identified in cervical tissues to date. The aim of this study was to identify the most stable gene or a set of genes as reference genes for RT-qPCR analysis in cervical tissues from a panel of 12 candidates (ALAS1, PPIA, GAPDH, HBB, TBP, ACTIN, B2M, MBNL2, PGKL, RPLP0, RPL-4, and EEF1A1). In total, 20 normal and 20 cervical cancer specimens were examined. Gene expression data were analyzed using two different statistical models (geNorm and NormFinder). EEF1A1 was identified as the most stable and reliable reference gene, followed by GAPDH and RPLP0, whereas EEF1A1 and GAPDH were the best two-gene combination by NormFinder. The expression validity of EEF1A1 was further determined in 21 normal, 22 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN(2-3)), and 18 cancer tissues; no expression differences were found among normal, CIN(2-3), and cancer tissues (P>0.05). Our results suggested that EEF1A1 can be used as a reference gene for normalization in gene profiling studies in clinic cervical samples, and the combination of EEF1A1 and GAPDH could be recommended as a much more reliable normalization strategy.","1096-0309","Analytical biochemistry","(405) 224-9",2010,"Yuanming","Shen","Y","Women's Reproductive Health Laboratory of Zhejiang Province, Women's Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310006, China."
20652825,"TNF-α mRNA expression correlates with TGF-β mRNA expression in vivo.","TNF-α is postulated to play a significant role in regulating TGF-β(1) expression. In lung fibroblasts, for example, TNF-α is supposed to induce TGF-β(1) via AP-1 activation. TNF-α receptor, knock-out mice are resistant to induced fibrosis and over-expression of TNF-α causes increased TGF-β(1) production in mice. Therefore, we investigated whether TNF-α mRNA levels are associated with the TGF-β(1) mRNA levels of blood leucocytes in humans. Quantitative real-time PCR of TNF-α and TGF-β(1) was performed in 118 Germans. Calculations of expression were made with the 2(-ΔΔCT) method. When the investigated population was divided in two groups (TNF-α low and TNF-α high) by the median of the determined TNF-α expression, highly significant (p < 0.0001) differences of TGF-β1 mRNA expression were revealed. Additionally, dividing the investigated population into quartiles of the determined TNF-α expression showed significantly different TGF-β1 mRNA expressions. Comparing the determined CT-values of TNF-α in context with these of TGF-β1, a coefficient of determination R(2) = 0.4635 was calculated. In this study we demonstrated in vivo a significant association of the relative TNF-α/B2M mRNA expression and the relative TGF-β(1)/B2M mRNA expression in 118 Germans.","1573-2576","Inflammation","(34) 255-9",2011,"Simone","Helmig","S","Institut und Poliklinik für Arbeits- und Sozialmedizin, Justus-Liebig-Universität, Aulweg 129, 35392, Giessen, Germany.

Five proteins and one decapeptide were selected for the study: C-reactive protein (CRP), beta-2-microglobulin (B2M), cystatine C (CysC), human serum albumin (HSA), Ara h1, and angiotensin I. The quantification was based on the determination of four amino acids, proline (Pro), isoleucine (Ile), valine (Val), and phenylalanine (Phe) within a working range between 5 and 100 pmol/injection of each amino acid, after 60 min digestion with HCl at 150°C. The amino acids were selected taking into account their abundance in the protein sequence and to include the more difficult to break peptide bonds. Quantification of the protein amounts calculated from each amino acid is consistent, indicating that the method is working reliably. This consistency points to a complete hydrolysis of the proteins. The trueness of the method was proven when dry mass determination after dialysis was applied to HSA and CRP and the results were compared to those from amino acid analysis. Traceability to SI was assured by extensive characterisation of the amino acid calibrants by nuclear magnetic resonance, neutron activation analysis, and Karl Fischer titration.","1096-0309","Analytical biochemistry","(408) 124-31",2011,"A","Muñoz","A","Joint Research Centre, Institute for Reference Material and Measurements, Geel, Belgium. amalia.MUNOZ-PINEIRO@ec.europa.eu"

The reliability of qPCR data is highly dependent on the use of appropriate reference genes for normalization. To date, no validated reference genes have been reported for the normalization of gene expression in B-CLL. Therefore, the present study was conducted to identify suitable reference genes for gene expression studies in CD19(+) B cells isolated from B-CLL patients' peripheral blood. The stability of ACTB, B2M, GAPDH, GUSB, HMBS, HPRT1, MRPL19, TBP and UBC genes was determined by three different descriptive statistics, geNorm, NormFinder and BestKeeper-1, which produced highly comparable results.

In contrast, the presence and function of VEGF in normal tissues like the lymph node has not been given much attention until now. To study the expression of VEGF, VEGFR-1, VEGFR-2 and VEGFR-3 in the heterogenous cell population of the canine lymph node, laser capture microdissection was used to isolate pure cell fractions of macrophages, lymphocytes, endothelial cells, and capsule cells of the canine lymph node. To clarify if macrophages take up VEGF from the environment or express VEGF, VEGFR-1, VEGFR-2 or VEGFR-3 themselves, the mRNA expression was studied by real-time RT-PCR. After RNA isolation and subsequent analysis with the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer only RNA samples with appropriate RNA integrity were used for real-time PCR. For the accurate relative quantification of mRNA expression levels several reference genes were evaluated. It was shown that the reference genes HPRT1 and B2M serve as reliable reference genes for gene expression studies in the canine lymph node. Expression data analysis revealed no significant difference in VEGF expression levels between endothelial cells and the other investigated cells. VEGFR-1 expression was significantly lower in lymphocytes. Also macrophages showed a highly significant lower expression of VEGFR-1 compared to endothelial cells. In addition, the VEGFR-2 expression in lymphocytes and macrophages was significantly lower in comparison to endothelial cells. We were not able to detect VEGFR-3 mRNA in the lymphocyte cell population, in macrophages and cells of the lymph node capsule VEGFR-3 was expressed at very low levels. It was shown that laser capture microdissection in combination with quantitative real-time PCR is a valuable tool for studying the expression patterns of specific cells in their microenvironment. Our results support the hypothesis that VEGF and its receptors have other biological roles besides stimulating angiogenesis in the normal lymph node. These biological functions need to be clarified in further studies.","1873-2534","Veterinary immunology and immunopathology","(140) 207-14",2011,"Alexander","Jais","A","VetOMICS Core Facility for Research, University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna, Veterinaerplatz 1, A-1210 Vienna, Austria."

However, no investigations on appropriate qRT-PCR reference genes have been documented. In this report, we determined the potential of eight housekeeping genes, i.e. β-actin (ACTB), ribosomal protein L17 (RPL17), α-tubulin (TUBA), elongation factor-1-α(EF1A), β-2-Microglobulin (B2M), RNA polymerase II subunit D (RPSD), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), and 18S ribosomal RNA (18S rRNA), as internal standards for qRT-PCR analysis of gene expression in turbot as a function of bacterial infection. For this purpose, the expression of the eight housekeeping genes in seven turbot tissues was determined by qRT-PCR before and after bacterial challenge, and the data were analyzed with the geNorm and NormFinder algorisms. The results showed that the expression of all the examined genes exhibited tissue-dependent variations both before and after bacterial challenge. Before bacterial challenge, geNorm and NormFinder identified RPSD as the gene that showed least tissue specific expression. At 12 h post-bacterial infection, geNorm ranked ACTB/GAPDH, 18S rRNA/ACTB, ACTB/GAPDH, 18S rRNA/ACTB, RPL17/TUBA, RPSD/GAPDH, and RPSD/B2M, respectively, as the most stably expressed genes in liver, spleen, kidney, gill, heart, muscle, and brain. Comparable ranking orders were produced by NormFinder. Similar results were obtained at 24 h post-bacterial infection. Taken together, these results indicate that RPSD is the most stable gene across tissue types under normal physiological conditions and that, during bacterial infection, ACTB might be used as an internal standard for the normalization of gene expression in immune relevant organs; however, no single gene or single pair of genes in the examined set of housekeeping genes can serve as a universal reference across all tissue types under the condition of bacterial infection.","1095-9947","Fish & shellfish immunology","(30) 720-8",2011,"Wei","Dang","W","Key Laboratory of Experimental Marine Biology, Institute of Oceanology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 7 Nanhai Road, Qingdao 266071, PR China."

Proteomic analysis was performed on 39 newly diagnosed MM patients treated with a thalidomide-based regimen (22 responders; 17 non-responders) using immunodepletion, 2-D DIGE analysis and mass spectrometry. Zinc-α-2-glycoprotein (ZAG), vitamin D-binding protein (VDB), serum amyloid-A protein (SAA) and β-2-microglobulin (B2M) had statistically significant higher concentrations in non-responders compared to responders, while haptoglobin (Hp) had a lower concentration. ELISAs were used to validate the candidate protein biomarkers using unfractionated serum from 51 newly diagnosed MM patients (29 responders; 22 non-responders). Using logistic regression, the best possible area under the curve (AUC) was 0.96 using ZAG, VDB and SAA in combination. Leave-one-out-cross-validation (LOOCV) indicated an overall predictive accuracy of 84% with associated sensitivity and specificity values of 81.8 and 86.2%, respectively. Subsequently, 16 of 22 thalidomide-refractory patients successfully achieved complete response or very good partial response using second-line treatment suggesting that the biomarker profile is specific to thalidomide response rather than identifying patients with MM refractory to all therapies.

Canine beta-2 microglobulin (B2M), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and KIT sequences were cloned into the psiCHECK™-2 vector. SiRNA molecules, designed to target gene-specific sequences, were co-transfected with plasmid DNA into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Renilla and firefly luciferase activity was measured using the Dual-GLO(®) Luciferase Assay (Promega). Using this reporter system, canine housekeeping gene-specific SiRNA molecules demonstrated knockdown of their targets (72.0% knockdown for B2M and 94.5% knockdown for GAPDH). An SiRNA molecule targeting exon 2 of canine KIT successfully knocked-down reporter gene expression of a KIT(26-407) construct (90.8% knockdown). An SiRNA molecule targeting a 48 base-pair in-tandem duplication mutation in KIT exon 11 selectively knocked down expression of the KIT(1569-1966mutant) construct (93.1% knockdown) but had no effect on the KIT(1569-1918wild-type) construct.

Endometrial biopsies were obtained from mares on day of ovulation (d0, n=4), at late diestrus (LD, n=4), after luteolyis (AL, n=4) of the cycle and on days 14 (P14; n=3), 18 (P18, n=3) and 22 (P22; n=3) of pregnancy. A model based on REML with support of descriptive statistics was proposed in accordance with experimental design and was further confirmed with principal component analysis (PCA). Results were compared with widely used software including geNorm, BestKeeper, and NormFinder. Results indicated that GAPDH was the most stable HKG and RPL32 was ranked as the second best. 18S and 28S were found to be the least stable.

21414303,"Critical selection of reliable reference genes for gene expression study in the HepaRG cell line.","The human HepaRG cell line has shown to be a valuable in vitro tool for repeated exposure to chemical compounds and to evaluate their potential toxic outcome. Seen the importance given by the actual EU legislation of cosmetics and chemical substances to the use of in vitro methods in human safety evaluation, one can expect that HepaRG cells will gain importance as human-relevant cell source. At the transcriptional level, RT-qPCR assays are often used to obtain quantitative results. The choice of internal control is important since it may affect the study outcome. Indeed, it is well-known that expression levels of traditional reference genes can vary across tissue types and across experimental settings within one specific tissue type. From a review of the scientific literature, it appears that, for HepaRG cells, S18 often is used as internal control, but without any evidence of its expression stability in this cell line. Therefore, we aimed to select the most optimal reference genes for gene expression studies in HepaRG cells and to check whether S18 is a suitable reference gene. Twelve candidate genes' expression stability level was analyzed by three algorithms (geNorm, BestKeeper, Normfinder), which identified the optimal single reference gene (TBP) and the most suitable set of reference genes (TBP, UBC, SDHA, RLP13, YHWAZ, HMBS, B2M and HPRT1) for HepaRG transcriptional profiling. This study provides a new set of reference genes that is suitable for testing whenever RT-qPCR data for HepaRG cells are generated. The most stable ones can then be selected for further normalization.","1873-2968","Biochemical pharmacology","(81) 1255-61",2011,"Liesbeth","Ceelen","L","Department of Toxicology, Faculty of Medicine and Pharmacy, Center for Pharmaceutical Research, Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Laarbeeklaan 103, Brussels, Belgium. lceelen@vub.ac.be"
21423363,"Functional relationships between genes associated with differentiation potential of aged myogenic progenitors.","Aging is accompanied by considerable heterogeneity with possible co-expression of differentiation pathways. The present study investigates the interplay between crucial myogenic, adipogenic, and Wnt-related genes orchestrating aged myogenic progenitor differentiation (AMPD) using clonal gene expression profiling in conjunction with Bayesian structure learning (BSL) techniques. The expression of three myogenic regulatory factor genes (Myogenin, Myf-5, MyoD1), four genes involved in regulating adipogenic potential (C/EBPα, DDIT3, FoxC2, PPARγ), and two genes in the Wnt signaling pathway (Lrp5, Wnt5a) known to influence both differentiation programs were determined across 34 clones by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Three control genes were used for normalization of the clonal expression data (18S, GAPDH, and B2M). Constraint-based BSL techniques, namely (a) PC Algorithm, (b) Grow-shrink (GS) algorithm, and (c) Incremental Association Markov Blanket (IAMB) were used to model the functional relationships (FRs) in the form of acyclic networks from the clonal expression profiles. A novel resampling approach that obviates the need for a user-defined confidence threshold is proposed to identify statistically significant FRs at small sample sizes. Interestingly, the resulting acyclic network consisted of FRs corresponding to myogenic, adipogenic, Wnt-related genes and their interaction. A significant number of these FRs were robust to normalization across the three house-keeping genes and the choice of the BSL technique. The results presented elucidate the delicate balance between differentiation pathways (i.e., myogenic as well as adipogenic) and possible cross-talk between pathways in AMPD.","1664-042X","Frontiers in physiology","(1) 21",2010,"Radhakrishnan","Nagarajan","R","Division of Biomedical Informatics, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences Little Rock, AR, USA. rnagarajan@uams.edu"

Five genes expressed in sow endometria on GD12 were evaluated for their suitability as internal control for relative quantification by qRT-PCR. These genes were beta-actin (ACTB), beta-2-microglobulin (B2M), phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (PGK1), RNA polymerase II polypeptide G (RPG), and ribosomal protein S20 (RPS20), which represent different functional classes. Our results indicated that ACTB, B2M, and PGK1 were not suitable as internal standards for normalization because of their huge variability between the two breeds. RPS20 and RPG were most stable, and the former is recommended to serve as the internal standard when the use of multiple housekeeping genes is unpractical.","1090-2104","Biochemical and biophysical research communications","(408) 265-8",2011,"Shouqi","Wang","S","Department of Animal Genetics, Breeding and Reproduction, College of Animal Science, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou, Guangdong 510642, China. shouqiw@163.com"

The aim of the study was to identify and validate reference gene to be used in RT-PCR studies of failing (HF) and non-failing pig hearts. Eight candidate reference genes (GAPDH, ACTB, B2M, TBP, HPRT-1, PPIA, TOP2B, YWHAZ) were selected to compare cardiac tissue of normal (n=4) and HF (n=5) minipigs. The most stable genes resulted: HPRT-1, TBP, PPIA (right and left atrium); PPIA, GAPDH, ACTB (right ventricle); HPRT-1, TBP, GAPDH (left ventricle). The normalization strategy was tested analyzing mRNA expression of TNF-α, which is known to be up-regulated in HF and whose variations resulted more significant when normalized with the appropriately selected reference genes. The findings obtained in this study underline the importance to provide a set of reference genes to normalize mRNA expression in HF and control minipigs. The use of unvalidated reference genes can generate biased results because also their expression could be altered by the experimental conditions.","1873-4863","Journal of biotechnology","(153) 92-9",2011,"Alessandro","Martino","A","University of Pisa, Department of Biology, Genetics Division, Italy."
21527436,"Identification of stable endogenous reference genes for real-time PCR in the human fetal gonad using an external standard technique.","Measurement of tissue mRNA transcript levels is critically dependent upon the normalization strategy used. For real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (RT-PCR) this commonly depends upon identification of stable (non-variable) endogenous reference genes, with housekeeping genes (HKGs) the most commonly used. In this report we describe the use of an external mRNA standard to identify stable HKGs in the human fetal gonad. Total RNA was extracted from second trimester human fetal gonads and a standard amount of luciferase mRNA was added at the start of the extraction process. Levels of luciferase were then measured relative to each of seven HKGs (SDHA, TBP, B2M, PMM1, SFRS4, HMBS and UBC) by RT-PCR. When normalized to tissue weight, HKG expression was constant across fetal ages. Measurement of overall variation in transcript expression showed that PMM1 was the most stable HKG in the ovary while B2M was most stable in the testis. Re-analysis of the data using GeNorm and NormFinder algorithms showed that two of the top three most stable HKGs were the same using all three methods. This study describes a method for identification of endogenous, stable reference genes for RT-PCR studies of transcript expression levels which is objective and not dependent on prior assumptions of HKG expression. This technique is likely to be applicable to most tissues and, in this case, identifies suitable HKGs for studies into human gonadal development.","1460-2407","Molecular human reproduction","(17) 620-5",2011,"Peter J","O'Shaughnessy","PJ","Institute of Biodiversity, Animal Health and Comparative Medicine, College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences, University of Glasgow, UK. peter.oshaughnessy@glasgow.ac.uk"

Investigations on innate immunological changes in fish that survives an acute bacterial infection are a few or lacking. An attempt was made to study the detailed changes in innate immune responses in P. sarana following an intraperitoneal challenge with Aeromonas hydrophila at 2.24 × 10(7)colony-forming unit (CFU)/fish. Sequential changes in transcription of immune related genes in liver and kidney, innate immune status, haematological profile and histopathology of major organs were studied after different time intervals post-challenge in the survivors. A significant increase in serum myeloperoxidase, ceruloplasmin activities and total leucocyte count, and decline in alternative complement activity were observed at early infection periods. A significant decline in plasma glucose level, total erythrocyte count, haemoglobin content and packed cell volume in blood was noticed after challenge. Superoxide radical production and serum antiprotease activity increased significantly at later period of challenge. In addition, few immune related genes pertinent to acute phase reactants and inflammatory response viz., complement component 3 (C3), lysozyme G, lysozyme C, β2-microglobulin (B2M), transferrin, interleukin 1β, interleukin 8, manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD), natural killer cell enhancing factor-B and chemokine CXCa were modulated after bacterial challenge. In liver, a significant up-regulation of C3 and transferrin, and down-regulation of lysozyme G, interleukin 8, MnSOD and B2M were noticed in survivors. On the contrary, lysozyme G, lysozyme C, interleukin 1β, interleukin 8, CXCa, and MnSOD were found to be significantly up-regulated and C3 was down-regulated in the kidney. All these data suggest that the innate immune factors were highly modulated during infection process to render protection of P. sarana to this bacterium.

Reliable standards were established for the normalization of qRT-PCR. Six potential reference genes were ranked by their stability using the geNorm and NormFinder programs.

Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and ribosomal RNA 18S (18SRNA) were discarded as reference genes due to their unstable expression patterns. When B2M and TBP genes were selected as standards in combination, rather than GAPDH, a significant upregulation in Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) expression was observed after 21 consecutive days of heat stress. These findings suggest that selection of an ideal reference gene is a key step in comparison of transcription profiles in Bama miniature pigs.","1873-2534","Veterinary immunology and immunopathology","(144) 160-6",2011,"Ju","Xiang-Hong","J","The South China Agricultural University, Key Laboratory of Animal Disease Control and Prevention, Ministry of Agriculture, College of Veterinary Medicine, Guangzhou 510642, China."

A similar ranking of reference genes was obtained by NormFinder, and the four most stable reference genes were identical using both approaches. UBC and YWHAZ were proposed to be the two most suitable reference genes based on the above analyses. To further assess the stabilities of the UBC and YWHAZ in a formal experiment, MCF7, HCT116 and HepG2 cell lines were subjected to treatments with 5-aza-dC and TSA. Both UBC and YWHAZ exhibited stable expression levels across control and treatment groups.

The approach, termed methylation-specific Ligation Detection Reaction (msLDR), was applied to test 16 loci in 8 different colorectal cancer cells in parallel. These loci encode immune regulatory genes involved in T-cell and natural killer cell activation, whose silencing is associated with the development or progression of colorectal cancer. Parallel analysis of HLA-A, HLA-B, STAT1, B2M, LMP2, LMP7, PA28α, TAP1, TAP2, TAPBP, ULBP2 and ULBP3 by msLDR in eight colorectal cancer cell lines showed preferential methylation at the HLA-B, ULBP2 and ULBB3 loci, but not at the other loci. MsLDR was found to represent a suitable and sensitive method for the detection of distinct methylation patterns as validated by conventional bisulphite Sanger sequencing and COBRA analysis. Since gene silencing by epigenetic mechanisms plays a central role during transformation of a normal differentiated somatic cell into a cancer cell, characterization of the gene methylation status in tumours is a major topic not only in basic research, but also in clinical diagnostics. Due to a very simple workflow, msLDR is likely to be applicable to clinical samples and thus comprises a potential diagnostic tool for clinical purposes.","1617-4623","Molecular genetics and genomics : MGG","(286) 279-91",2011,"Felix","Bormann","F","Institute of Pathology, University Medicine Charité, Charitéplatz1, 10117 Berlin, Germany. felix.bormann@charite.de"

In this study, we spearheaded noninvasive detection of ovarian cancer by salivary transcriptomic biomarkers, and evaluated the clinical utilities of discovered biomarkers using a clinical case-control study. To find salivary mRNA biomarkers, salivary transcriptomes in 11 ovarian cancer patients and 11 matched controls were profiled by Affymetrix HG-U133-Plus-2.0 array. The biomarker candidates selected from the microarray results were then subjected to clinical validation by RT-qPCR using an independent sample cohort including 21 ovarian cancer patients and 35 healthy controls. Seven downregulated mRNA biomarkers were validated. The logistic regression model revealed the combination of five validated biomarkers (AGPAT1, B2M, BASP2, IER3, and IL1B) can significantly discriminate ovarian cancer patients (n = 21) from the healthy controls (n = 35), yielding a receiver operating characteristic plot, area under the curve value of 0.909 with 85.7% sensitivity and 91.4% specificity. In summary, we have demonstrated that the RNA signatures in saliva could serve as biomarkers for detection of ovarian cancer with high sensitivity and specificity.

Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), cystatin C (CysC) and beta-2-microglobulin (B2M) are measures of renal function. It remains unclear, which of these parameters is the strongest predictor of outcome in patients with atherosclerosis. All-cause and cardiovascular mortality were prospectively investigated in 1,065 consecutive patients with asymptomatic carotid atherosclerosis. During a median follow-up of 6.3 years 275 patients died (25.8%), including 182 (66.2%) from cardiovascular causes. Estimated GFR, CysC and B2M were all significantly and independently associated with mortality. Inclusion of the renal parameters CysC and B2M but not of eGFR into a model with established cardiovascular risk factors improved the C-statistics significantly (p=0.0035 and 0.036, respectively; p=0.182 for eGFR). The net reclassification improvement (NRI) was 32.4% (p<0.0001) for CysC, 29% (p<0.0001) for B2M, and 16.5% (p=0.019) for eGFR. The integrated discrimination improvement (IDI) was 0.014 (p=0.0009) for CysC and 0.011 (p=0.005) for B2M while it was not significant for eGFR. Results were consistent for various subgroups with different extent of atherosclerosis. In summary, CysC and B2M were found to be independent predictors for mortality and had superior predictive value compared to eGFR in patients with asymptomatic carotid atherosclerosis. The clinical importance of these findings has to be validated in larger studies with a community-based approach.","2567-689X","Thrombosis and haemostasis","(107) 150-7",2012,"Matthias","Hoke","M","Department of Internal Medicine II, Division of Angiology, Vienna General Hospital, Medical University, Währinger Gürtel 18-20, A-1090 Vienna, Austria. matthias.hoke@meduniwien.ac.at"
22352188,"The role of fluorescence in situ hybridization and gene expression profiling in myeloma risk stratification.","Multiple myeloma patients' survival under treatment varies from a few months to more than 15 years. Clinical prognostic factors, especially beta2-microglobulin (B2M) and the international staging system (ISS), allow risk assessment to a certain extent, but do not identify patients at very high risk. As malignant plasma cells are characterized by a variety of chromosomal aberrations and changes in gene expression, a molecular characterization ofCD138-purified myeloma cells by interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (iFISH) and gene expression profiling (GEP) can be used for improved risk assessment, iFISH allows a risk stratification with presence of a translocation t(4;14) and/or deletion of 17p13 being the best documented adverse prognostic factors. A deletion of 13q14 is no longer considered to define adverse risk. Patients harbouring a t(4;14) seems to benefit from a bortezomib- or lenalidomide containing regimen, whereas patients with deletion 17p13 seem only to benefit from a high dose therapy approach using long term bortezomib (in induction and maintenance) and autologous tandem-transplantation as used in the GMMG-HD4 trial, or the total therapy 3 concept. Gene expression profiling allows the assessment of high risk scores (IFM, UAMS), remaining prognostic despite treatment with novel agents, and prognostic surrogates of biological factors (e.g. proliferation) and (prognostic) target gene expression (e.g. Aurora-kinase A). Thus, assessment of B2M and ISS-stage, iFISH, and GEP is considered extended routine diagnostics in therapy requiring multiple myeloma patients for risk assessment and, even now, to a certain extent selection of treatment.","0370-8179","Srpski arhiv za celokupno lekarstvo","(139 Suppl 2) 84-9",2011,"Dirk","Hose","D","Medizinische Klinik V, Universitätsklinikum Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany. dirk.hose@med.uni-heidelberg.de"

By massively parallel mRNA sequencing, we obtained 1.2 billion reads from 17 individual human tissues belonging to TNBC, Non-TNBC, and HER2-positive breast cancers and defined their comprehensive digital transcriptome for the first time. Surprisingly, we identified a high number of novel and unannotated transcripts, revealing the global breast cancer transcriptomic adaptations. Comparative transcriptomic analyses elucidated differentially expressed transcripts between the three breast cancer groups, identifying several new modulators of breast cancer. Our study also identified common transcriptional regulatory elements, such as highly abundant primary transcripts, including osteonectin, RACK1, calnexin, calreticulin, FTL, and B2M, and ""genomic hotspots"" enriched in primary transcripts between the three groups. Thus, our study opens previously unexplored niches that could enable a better understanding of the disease and the development of potential intervention strategies.","2045-2322","Scientific reports","(2) 264",2012,"Jeyanthy","Eswaran","J","McCormick Genomic and Proteomics Center, The George Washington University, Washington, DC 20037, USA."
22367717,"Translating the brain transcriptome in neuroAIDS: from non-human primates to humans.","In the post-human genome project era, high throughput techniques to detect and computational algorithms to analyze differentially expressed genes have proven to be powerful tools for studying pathogenesis of neuroAIDS. Concurrently, discovery of non-coding RNAs and their role in development and disease has underscored the importance of examining the entire transcriptome instead of protein coding genes alone. Herein, we review the documented changes in brain RNA expression profiles in the non-human primate model of neuroAIDS (SIV infected monkeys) and compare the findings to those resulting from studies in post-mortem human samples of neuroAIDS. Differential expression of mRNAs involved in inflammation and immune response are a common finding in both monkey and human samples - even in HIV infected people on combination antiretroviral therapy, a shared set of genes is upregulated in the brains of both infected monkeys and humans: B2M, IFI44, IFIT3, MX1, STAT1. Additionally, alterations in ion channel encoding genes have been observed in the human studies. Brain miRNA profiling has also been performed, and up-regulation of two miRNAs originating from the same transcript, miR-142-3p and miR-142-5p, is common to human and monkey neuroAIDS studies. With increases in knowledge about the genome and advances in technology, unraveling alterations in the transcriptome in the SIV/monkey model will continue to enrich our knowledge about the effects of HIV on the brain.","1557-1904","Journal of neuroimmune pharmacology : the official journal of the Society on NeuroImmune Pharmacology","(7) 372-9",2012,"Jessica M","Winkler","JM","Department of Pharmacology and Experimental Neuroscience, University of Nebraska Medical Center, 985800 Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE 68198-5800, USA."

Most B7 family members contain both variable (V)- and constant (C)-type domains of the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF). Through in silico screening of the Xenopus genome and subsequent phylogenetic analysis, we found novel genes belonging to the B7 family, one of which is the recently discovered B7H6. Humans and rats have a single B7H6 gene; however, many B7H6 genes were detected in a single large cluster in the Xenopus genome. The B7H6 expression patterns also varied in a species-specific manner. Human B7H6 binds to the activating natural killer receptor, NKp30. While the NKp30 gene is single-copy and maps to the MHC in most vertebrates, many Xenopus NKp30 genes were found in a cluster on a separate chromosome that does not harbor the MHC. Indeed, in all species so far analyzed from sharks to mammals, the number of NKp30 and B7H6 genes correlates well, suggestive of receptor-ligand co-evolution. Furthermore, we identified a Xenopus-specific B7 homolog (B7HXen) and revealed its close linkage to B2M, which we have demonstrated previously to have been originally encoded in the MHC. Thus, our study provides further proof that the B7 precursor was included in the proto MHC. Additionally, the comparative analysis revealed a new B7 family member, B7H7, which was previously designated in the literature as an unknown gene, HHLA2.","1432-1211","Immunogenetics","(64) 571-90",2012,"Martin F","Flajnik","MF","Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Maryland, Baltimore, MD 21201, USA."
22489943,"Closing the gap: discrimination of the expression profile of HLA questionable alleles by a cytokine-induced secretion approach using HLA-A*32:11Q.","Matching of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles between donors and recipients plays a major role in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Null or questionably expressed HLA allelic variants are a major issue in HLA matching, because the aberrant expression of such alleles can have a major impact on the outcome of HSCT and/or its complications such as graft-versus-host disease. The goal of this study was to investigate the potential of a recently developed cytokine-induced secretion assay to differentiate the expression levels of HLA-A*32:11Q (questionable) into a null (N) or low (L) expression variant. An amino acid mutation at position 164 of HLA-A*32:11Q disrupts the disulfide bridge in the α2 domain. HLA-A*32:11Q is not detectable by standard microlymphocytotoxicity assay. To this end, we cloned soluble HLA-A*32:11Q and a reference allele (HLA-A*32:01) into expression vectors and transfected/transduced HEK293 and K562 cells. Allele-expressing K562 cells were simultaneously transfected/transduced with a β2-microglobulin (B2M)-encoding vector to ensure the intact HLA structure with B2M. After treatment with proinflammatory cytokines, secreted soluble HLA molecules were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in the supernatant and intracellular accumulation of the recombinant proteins by flow cytometry. HLA-A*32:11Q was nearly undetectable in untreated transfectants. Cytokine treatment increased the secretion of HLA-A*32:11Q to detectable levels and resulted in intracellular accumulation of the allele. There was no difference in mRNA transcription between the A*32 alleles. On the basis of these results, we recommend reclassification of HLA-A*32:11Q as a low expression (L) variant.","1399-0039","Tissue antigens","(79) 340-50",2012,"D","Föll","D","Institute for Transfusion Medicine, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany."

To reliably detect small changes, the use of a reference gene (RG) that is stably expressed under all conditions is essential. The large number of different RGs used in the field and the lack of validation of their suitability make the comparison between studies impossible. Therefore, this work aims to establish one single RG for mesodermal differentiation studies that use MSCs. Seven commonly used RGs (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase [GAPDH], ribosomal protein L13a [RPL13a], beta-actin [ACTB], tyrosine 3-monooxygenase/tryptophan 5-monooxygenase activation protein, zeta-polypeptide [YWHAZ], eukaryotic translational elongation factor 1 alpha [EF1α], β2-microglobulin [B2M], and 18S ribosomal RNA [18S]) were investigated concerning their mRNA expression stability during expansion of bone marrow-derived MSCs up to four passages as well as during their adipo-, chondro-, and osteogenenic differentiation on days 9, 16, and 22 after induction. RPL13a was validated for qPCR studies of MSCs (bone marrow- and placenta-derived) and, additionally, for primary human bone cells (HBCs) and the osteosarcoma cell line MG-63. GAPDH and ACTB, the two most frequently used RGs, showed the highest expression variance. The superior performance of RPL13a should make it the RG of choice for all MSC studies addressing mesodermal differentiation.","1937-3392","Tissue engineering.

22565016,"Kidney dysfunction and cadmium exposure--factors influencing dose-response relationships.","Our early toxicological studies showed that metallothionein (MT) is a protein that carries cadmium (Cd) to the kidney, explaining why Cd exposures during long time periods may give rise to kidney dysfunction. This dysfunction is usually considered to be the critical effect, i.e. the adverse effect that occurs at the lowest exposure level. MT also provides intracellular protection against cadmium toxicity. In studies of population groups in cadmium contaminated areas in China, we investigated factors that affected the relationship between internal dose of Cd, as indicated by blood Cd (BCd) or urinary Cd (UCd), and the prevalence of kidney dysfunction. We found dose-response relationships between UCd and the prevalence of increased levels of biomarkers of renal tubular dysfunction (urinary beta-2-microglobulin, B2M, or N-acetyl-beta-d-glucosaminidase - NAG) or urinary albumin (UAlb), a biomarker of glomerular kidney dysfunction. Two years after Cd intake from contaminated rice was diminished, renal tubular dysfunction appeared unchanged or aggravated among those with higher UCd; Another 8 years later, i.e. 10 years after Cd intake was decreased, the prevalence of renal tubular dysfunction was still increased but UAlb had returned to normal. Factors that influenced the dose-response relationships were: (1) time after maximum exposure. (2) Concomitant exposure to other nephrotoxic agents such as inorganic arsenic. (3) Cd induced metallothionein mRNA levels in peripheral blood lymphocytes, used as a biomarker of the ability of each person, to synthesize MT. (4) The occurrence of increased levels in blood plasma of autoantibodies against MT. The two last points further support a role in humans of MT as a protective protein against tissue damage from cadmium and gives support to previous ideas developed partly in experimental systems.","1878-3252","Journal of trace elements in medicine and biology : organ of the Society for Minerals and Trace Elements (GMS)","(26) 197-200",2012,"Gunnar","Nordberg","G","Occupational and Environmental Medicine, Department of Public Health and Clinical Medicine, Umea University, SE-90187 Umea, Sweden. gunnar.nordberg@envmed.umu.se"

Here we report a proteomics platform that alleviates these difficulties and demonstrate its effectiveness in fractionating heterogeneous cultures of early endoderm derived from human embryonic stem cells. The approach, designated differential cell-capture antibody array, is based on highly parallel, comparative screening of live cell populations using hundreds of antibodies directed against cell-surface antigens. We used this platform to fractionate the hitherto unresolved early endoderm compartment of CXCR4+ cells and identify several endoderm (CD61+ and CD63+) and non-endoderm (CD271+, CD49F+, CD44+ and B2M+) sub-populations. We provide evidence that one of these sub-populations, CD61+, is directly derived from CXCR4+ cells, displays characteristic kinetics of emergence, and exhibits a distinct gene expression profile. The results demonstrate the potential of the cell-capture antibody array as a powerful proteomics tool for detailed dissection of heterogeneous cellular systems.","1535-9484","Molecular & cellular proteomics : MCP","(11) 586-95",2012,"Revital","Sharivkin","R","Department of Biological Chemistry, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, 76100, Israel."

Nine candidate reference genes [glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit 11 (PPP1R11), β-actin (ACTB), β-2 microglobulin (B2M), 40S ribosomal protein S15a (RPS15A), ubiquitously expressed transcript (UXT), mitochondrial GTPase 1 (MTG1), 18S rRNA (RN18S1), and ubiquitin (UBC)] were evaluated. Three genes, β-casein (CSN2), lactoferrin (LTF), and cathelicidin (CAMP) were chosen as target genes. Very high amplification was observed in 7 ICG and very low level amplification was observed in 2 ICG (UXT and MTG1). Thus, UXT and MTG1 were excluded from further analysis. The qPCR data were analyzed by 2 software packages, geNorm and NormFinder, to determine suitable reference genes, based on their stability and expression. Overall, PPP1R11, ACTB, UBC, and GAPDH were stably expressed among all candidate reference genes.

22624560,"The functional significance of E277K and V295A HFE  mutations.","Hereditary haemochromatosis (HH) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by excessive intestinal iron absorption resulting in increased pathological body iron stores. It is typically associated with homozygosity for the c.845G>A (p.C282Y) mutation in the HFE gene. However, other HFE alterations have been reported in affected individuals but their association with the disease is unclear. This study analysed the functional consequences of two HFE mutations, c.829G>A (p.E277K) and c.884T>C (p.V295A). Firstly, it was shown that c.829G>A affects the HFE splicing by diminishing the full length HFE and ivs4_66bp inclusion transcript levels, while increasing the amount of exon 4 skipping transcript. Immunofluorescent techniques showed that the HFE_E277K protein had a diffuse distribution (similar to HFE_C282Y) while HFE_V295A presented at the cell surface and perinuclear compartments (resembling HFE_wt). Immunoprecipitation assays revealed a decreased association of HFE_E277K and HFE_V295A with both β2-microglobulin (B2M; 38 ± 7% and 66 ± 8%, respectively) and transferrin receptor (TFRC, also termed TFR1) (58 ± 2% and 49 ± 16%, respectively). Herein, we prove that both mutations partially abrogate HFE association with B2M and TFRC, crucial for its correct processing and cell surface presentation. Although E277K has a more deleterious effect than V295A, we propose that both mutations may play a role in the development of hereditary haemochromatosis.","1365-2141","British journal of haematology","(158) 399-408",2012,"Bruno","Silva","B","Departamento de Genética, Instituto Nacional de Saúde Dr. Ricardo Jorge, Lisboa, Portugal."

Most of the known functions of HLA-G concern the membrane-bound HLA-G1 and soluble HLA-G5 isoforms, which present the typical structure of classical HLA class I molecule: a heavy chain of three globular domains α1-α2-α3 non-covalently bound to β-2-microglobulin (B2M) and a peptide. Very little is known of the structural features and functions of other HLA-G isoforms or structural conformations other than B2M-associated HLA-G1 and HLA-G5. In the present work, we studied the capability of all isoforms to form homomultimers, and investigated whether they could bind to, and function through, the known HLA-G receptors LILRB1 and LILRB2. We report that all HLA-G isoforms may form homodimers, demonstrating for the first time the existence of HLA-G4 dimers. We also report that the HLA-G α1-α3 structure, which constitutes the extracellular part of HLA-G2 and HLA-G6, binds the LILRB2 receptor but not LILRB1. This is the first report of a receptor for a truncated HLA-G isoform. Following up on this finding, we show that the α1-α3-Fc structure coated on agarose beads is tolerogenic and capable of prolonging the survival of skin allografts in B6-mice and in a LILRB2-transgenic mouse model. This study is the first proof of concept that truncated HLA-G isoforms could be used as therapeutic agents.

We aim to evaluate the reference gene expression stability in thawed renal cell carcinoma samples. Sixteen matched malignant and nonmalignant renal tissue samples were obtained and each sample was divided into 4 aliquots before being snap frozen and stored at -80°C. By quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, a time-course study was conducted on the thawed tissue to evaluate the expression stability of a panel of the 10 most frequently used reference genes in renal cell carcinom samples: ACTB, ALAS1, B2M, GAPDH, HMBS, HPRT, PPIA, RPLP0,TBP, and TUBB. As shown by geNorm M values, PPIA was the most stable gene at the 0-, 15-, and 30-minute time points (M=0.82, 0.85, and 0.76, respectively), whereas GAPDH was ranked last at the 5-, 15-, and 30-minute time points (M=1.38, 1.44, and 1.39, respectively). A positive correlation was found by linear regression between the thawing time and 2 to the power of crossing point values of all candidate reference genes (P<0.05). The mean coefficient of variance of all reference genes increased significantly at time points 5, 15, and 30 minutes compared with 0 minutes (P<0.01). In conclusion, using the geNorm algorithm, PPIA was identified as the most stably expressed gene between malignant and nonmalignant renal tissue samples that were thawed for similar time periods. All the reference genes showed high variations along with the thawing time; it should be recommended to use a combination of several candidate reference genes when comparing samples thawed for different time periods.","1533-4066","Diagnostic molecular pathology : the American journal of surgical pathology, part B","(21) 157-63",2012,"Yi","Ma","Y","Department of Biobank, Renji Hospital, Shanghai JiaoTong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China."

Here we studied the relationship of plasma B2M levels to clinical and cardiovascular outcomes in 142 patients (mean age of 67 years) at different stages of CKD.

During a mean follow-up of 969 days, 44 patients died and 49 suffered a cardiovascular event. Higher B2M levels were independently associated with overall and cardiovascular mortality and cardiovascular events in the whole cohort and with cardiovascular events in the predialysis cohort. Moreover, B2M appeared to be a better predictor than well-established factors associated with outcomes in this population, such as estimated glomerular filtration rate ((eGFR), only for predialysis patients), inflammation biomarkers, and other factors included in a propensity score. Thus, we confirm the strong relationship between B2M levels and eGFR and confirm the power of B2M to predict overall and cardiovascular mortality and cardiovascular events in patients at different stages of CKD.","1523-1755","Kidney international","(82) 1297-303",2012,"Sophie","Liabeuf","S","INSERM U-1088, Amiens, France."
22923469,"A theranostic small interfering RNA nanoprobe protects pancreatic islet grafts from adoptively transferred immune rejection.","Islet transplantation has recently emerged as an acceptable clinical modality for restoring normoglycemia in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). The long-term survival and function of islet grafts is compromised by immune rejection-related factors. Downregulation of factors that mediate immune rejection using RNA interference holds promise for improving islet graft resistance to damaging factors after transplantation. Here, we used a dual-purpose therapy/imaging small interfering (si)RNA magnetic nanoparticle (MN) probe that targets β(2) microglobulin (B2M), a key component of the major histocompatibility class I complex (MHC I). In addition to serving as a siRNA carrier, this MN-siB2M probe enables monitoring of graft persistence noninvasively using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Human islets labeled with these MNs before transplantation into B2M (null) NOD/scid mice showed significantly improved preservation of graft volume starting at 2 weeks, as determined by longitudinal MRI in an adoptive transfer model (P < 0.05). Furthermore, animals transplanted with MN-siB2M-labeled islets demonstrated a significant delay of up to 23.8 ± 4.8 days in diabetes onset after the adoptive transfer of T cells relative to 6.5 ± 4.5 days in controls. This study demonstrated that our approach could protect pancreatic islet grafts from immune rejection and could potentially be applied to allotransplantation and prevention of the autoimmune recurrence of T1DM in islet transplantation or endogenous islets.","1939-327X","Diabetes","(61) 3247-54",2012,"Ping","Wang","P","Molecular Imaging Laboratory, MGH/MIT/HMS Athinoula A.

Deoxynivalenol (DON), T-2 and HT-2 toxins belong to this family and are produced by various species of Fusarium. The H295R steroidogenesis assay, regulation of steroidogenic gene expression and reporter gene assays (RGAs) for the detection of androgen, estrogen, progestagen and glucocorticoid (ant)agonist responses, have been used to assess the endocrine disrupting activity of DON, T-2 and HT-2 toxins. H295R cells were used as a model for steroidogenesis and gene expression studies and exposed with either DON (0.1-1000ng/ml), T-2 toxin (0.0005-5ng/ml) or HT-2 toxin (0.005-50ng/ml) for 48h. We observed a reduction in hormone levels in media of exposed cells following radioimmunoassay. Cell viability was determined by four colorimetric assays and we observed reduced cell viability with increasing toxin concentrations partly explaining the significant reduction in hormone levels at the highest toxin concentration of all three trichothecenes. Thirteen of the 16 steroidogenic genes analyzed by quantitative real time PCR (RT-qPCR) were significantly regulated (P<0.05) by DON (100ng/ml), T-2 toxin (0.5ng/ml) and HT-2 toxin (5ng/ml) compared to the control, with reference genes (B2M, ATP5B and ACTB). Whereas HMGR and CYP19 were down-regulated, CYP1A1 and CYP21 were up-regulated by all three trichothecenes. DON further up-regulated CYP17, HSD3B2, CYP11B2 and CYP11B1 and down-regulated NR5A1. T-2 toxin caused down-regulation of NR0B1 and NR5A1 whereas HT-2 toxin induced up-regulation of EPHX and HSD17B1 and down-regulation of CYP11A and CYP17. The expressions of MC2R, StAR and HSD17B4 genes were not significantly affected by any of the trichothecenes in the present study. Although the results indicate that there is no evidence to suggest that DON, T-2 and HT-2 toxins directly interact with the steroid hormone receptors to cause endocrine disruption, the present findings indicate that exposure to DON, T-2 toxin and HT-2 toxin have effects on cell viability, steroidogenesis and alteration in gene expression indicating their potential as endocrine disruptors.","1879-3169","Toxicology letters","(214) 268-78",2012,"D G","Ndossi","DG","Norwegian School of Veterinary Science, Oslo, Norway; Sokoine University of Agriculture, Morogoro, Tanzania. doreen.ndossi@nvh.no"

Data was analyzed using geNorm and NormFinder softwares. The expression stability of the seven RGs decreased in order of DDX5/GAPDH/HMBS, 18S rRNA, YWHAZ, 28S rRNA and B2M. qRT-PCR analyses demonstrated that DDX5, GAPDH and HMBS were among the best stably expressed markers under all conditions. Both, geNorm and NormFinder, analyses proposed same RGs as the least variables. Evaluation of the expression levels of two target genes utilizing different endogenous controls, using REST-MCS software, revealed that the normalization method applied might introduce errors in the estimation of relative quantities. We concluded that when qRT-PCR is designed for studies of gene expression in U87MG cell lines treated with IFNs type I and II or their combinations, the use of all three GAPDH, HMBS and DDX5 (or their combinations in pairs) as RGs for data normalizations is recommended.","1573-4978","Molecular biology reports","(39) 11167-75",2012,"Dania","Vázquez-Blomquist","D","Department of Genomic, Center for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, Ave. 31 e/158 & 190, Playa, 10600, Havana, Cuba. dania.vazquez@cigb.edu.cu"

In this study, defects were made in rabbit articular cartilage, with or without insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) treatment, to create different chondrocyte living environments. The stability and intensity of the expressions of the candidate reference genes glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), 18S Ribosomal RNA (18S rRNA), cyclophilin (CYP), hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl transferase (HPRT1), and beta-2-microglobulin (B2M) were evaluated. The data were analyzed by geNorm and NormFinder. B2M and 18S rRNA were identified to be suitable reference genes for rabbit cartilage tissues.","1422-0067","International journal of molecular sciences","(13) 14344-55",2012,"Xiao-Xiang","Peng","XX","Shandong Provincial Key Laboratory of Clinical Laboratory Diagnostics, Department of Medical Laboratory, Weifang Medical University, Shandong 261053, China. dongchun.liang@hotmail.com."
23226803,"Detection of the Epstein-Barr virus in blood and bone marrow mononuclear cells of patients with aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is not associated with prognosis.","The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is associated with a large spectrum of lymphoproliferative diseases. Traditional methods of EBV detection include the immunohistochemical identification of viral proteins and DNA probes to the viral genome in tumoral tissue. The present study explored the detection of the EBV genome, using the BALF5 gene, in the bone marrow or blood mononuclear cells of patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCL) and related its presence to the clinical variables and risk factors. The results show that EBV detection in 21.5% of patients is not associated with age, gender, staging, B symptoms, international prognostic index scores or any analytical parameters, including lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) or β-2 microglobulin (B2M). The majority of patients were treated with R-CHOP-like (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisolone or an equivalent combination) and some with CHOP-like chemotherapy. Response rates [complete response (CR) + partial response (PR)] were not significantly different between EBV-negative and -positive cases, with 93.2 and 88.9%, respectively. The survival rate was also similar in the two groups, with 5-year overall survival (OS) rates of 64.3 and 76.7%, respectively. However, when analyzing the treatment groups separately there was a trend in EBV-positive patients for a worse prognosis in patients treated with CHOP-like regimens that was not identified in patients treated with R-CHOP-like regimens. We conclude that EBV detection in the bone marrow and blood mononuclear cells of DLBC patients has the same frequency of EBV detection on tumoral lymphoma tissue but is not associated with the risk factors, response rate and survival in patients treated mainly with immunochemotherapy plus rituximab. These results also suggest that the addition of rituximab to chemotherapy improves the prognosis associated with EBV detection in DLBCL.","1792-1074","Oncology letters","(4) 1285-1289",2012,"Herlander","Marques","H","Life and Health Sciences Research Institute (ICVS), School of Health Sciences, University of Minho; ; Department of Oncology, Hospital of Braga, Braga;"
23229008,"Identification of optimal housekeeping genes for examination of gene expression in bovine corpus luteum.","The selection of proper housekeeping genes for studies requiring genes expression normalization is an important step in the appropriate interpretation of results. The expression of housekeeping genes is regulated by many factors including age, gender, type of tissue or disease. The aim of the study was to identify optimal housekeeping genes in the corpus luteum obtained from cyclic or pregnant cows. The mRNA expression of thirteen housekeeping genes: C2orf29, SUZ12, TBP, TUBB2B, ZNF131, HPRT1, 18s RNA, GAPDH, SF3A1, SDHA, MRPL12, B2M and ACTB was measured by Real-time PCR. Range of cycle threshold (C(t)) values of the tested genes varied between 12 and 30 cycles, and 18s RNA had the highest coefficient of variation, whereas C2orf29 had the smallest coefficient. GeNorm software demonstrated C2orf29 and TBP as the most stable and 18s RNA and B2M as the most unstable housekeeping genes. Using the proposed cut-off value (0.15), no more than two of the best GeNorm housekeeping genes are proposed to be used in studies requiring gene expression normalization. NormFinder software demonstrated C2orf29 and SUZ12 as the best and 18s RNA and B2M as the worst housekeeping genes. The study indicates that selection of housekeeping genes may essentially affect the quality of the gene expression results.","2300-732X","Reproductive biology","(12) 362-7",2012,"Robert","Rekawiecki","R","Institute of Animal Reproduction and Food Research of Polish Academy of Science, Olsztyn, Poland. r.rekawiecki@pan.olsztyn.pl"

The aim of the study was to evaluate the clinical significance and the relationship between serum levels of sIL-6R, with various stimulators of angiogenesis, such as hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and interleukin-18 (IL-18) and with markers of proliferation, such as beta-2 microglobulin (B2M) levels and plasma cell Ki-67 proliferation index in the bone marrow, in patients with multiple myeloma (MM). We studied 45 newly diagnosed MM patients. Serum levels of sIL-6R, HGF, IL-18, and B2M and Ki-67 proliferation index (Ki-67 PI) in bone marrow's plasma cells were determined. The mean concentrations of sIL-6R, HGF, IL-18, and B2M and the value of Ki-67 were significantly higher in the patients compared to controls and with increasing disease stage. sIL-6R was strongly positively correlated with HGF, IL-18, B2M, and Ki-67 PI. There is a positive correlation between plasma cell growth, as determined by Ki-67 PI, and different angiogenic cytokines, such as HGF and IL-18, with sIL-6R.

Due to a diversity in putative reference genes expression stability in different in vitro models, a validation of an internal control gene should be made for each particular tissue or cell type and every specific experimental design. A few approaches have been proposed for reference gene selection, including pair-wise comparison approach and model-based approach. In this article we have assessed the expression stability of eight putative reference genes: ACTB, B2M, GADD45A, GAPDH, HPRT1, PES1, PSMC4, YWHAZ, in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) treated with different statins and with TNF-α. The analysis was performed with three reference gene validation programs: geNorm, NormFinder and BestKeeper. We have shown that hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase 1 gene (HPRT1) and tyrosine 3-monooxygenase/tryptophan 5-monooxygenase activation protein, zeta polypeptide gene (YWHAZ) are the most stably expressed genes among the analyzed ones. Furthermore, our results show that β-actin gene (ACTB) is downregulated by statins and thus should not be used as a normalizing gene in a discussed experimental setup. A ranking of candidate reference genes stability values is provided and might serve as a valuable guide for future gene expression studies in endothelial cells.

After 24 h, mRNA was extracted and gene expression was analyzed by Real-time qPCR. Nine candidates to reference genes for gene expression studies in this model were analyzed (aminolevulinate, delta-, synthase 1 (ALAS1); beta-actin (ACTB); beta-2-microglobulin (B2M); glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH); hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase 1 (HPRT1); succinate dehydrogenase complex, subunit A, flavoprotein (Fp) (SDHA); TATA box binding protein (TBP); ubiquitin C (UBC); tyrosine 3-monooxygenase/tryptophan 5-monooxygenase activation protein, zeta polypeptide (YWHAZ)). Expression stability was calculated NormFinder algorithm to find the most stable genes. NormFinder calculated SDHA as the most stable gene and the gene with the lowest intergroup and intragroup variation, and indicated GAPDH and SDHA as the best combination of two genes for the purpose of normalization. Androgen receptor mRNA expression was evaluated after normalization by each candidate gene and showed statistical difference in the transfected group compared to control group only when normalized by combination of GAPDH and SDHA.

Therefore, we firstly used miR-9-expressing CNE2 cells to determine the effects of miR-9 overexpression on global gene expression profile by microarray analysis. Microarray-based gene expression data unexpectedly demonstrated a significant number of up- or down-regulated immune- and inflammation-related genes, including many well-known interferon (IFN)-induced genes (e.g., IFI44L, PSMB8, IRF5, PSMB10, IFI27, PSB9_HUMAN, IFIT2, TRAIL, IFIT1, PSB8_HUMAN, IRF1, B2M and GBP1), major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules (e.g., HLA-B, HLA-C, HLA-F and HLA-H) and interleukin (IL)-related genes (e.g., IL20RB, GALT, IL7, IL1B, IL11, IL1F8, IL1A, IL6 and IL7R), which was confirmed by qRT-PCR. Moreover, the overexpression of miR-9 with the miRNA mimics significantly up- or down-regulated the expression of above-mentioned IFN-inducible genes, MHC class I molecules and IL-related genes; on the contrary, miR-9 inhibition by anti-miR-9 inhibitor in CNE2 and 5-8F cells correspondingly decreased or increased the aforementioned immune- and inflammation-related genes. Taken together, these findings demonstrate, for the first time, that miR-9 can modulate the expression of IFN-induced genes and MHC class I molecules in human cancer cells, suggesting a novel role of miR-9 in linking inflammation and cancer, which remains to be fully characterized.","1090-2104","Biochemical and biophysical research communications","(431) 610-6",2013,"Fei","Gao","F","Cancer Research Institute, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou 510515, PR China."

We show that the presence of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in samples of patients with primary and metastatic breast cancer can be detected with an array of selected tumor-marker-genes by reverse transcription real-time PCR. The focus of the presented work is on detecting differences in gene expression between healthy individuals and adjuvant and metastatic breast cancer patients, not an accurate quantification of these differences. Therefore, total RNA was isolated from blood samples of healthy donors and patients with primary or metastatic breast cancer after enrichment of mononuclear cells by density gradient centrifugation. After reverse transcription real-time PCR was carried out with a set of marker genes (BCSP, CK8, Her2, MGL, CK18, CK19). B2M and GAPDH were used as reference genes. Blood samples from patients with metastatic disease revealed increased cytokine gene levels in comparison to normal blood samples. Detection of a single gene was not sufficient to detect CTCs by reverse transcription real-time PCR. Markers used here were selected based on a recent study detecting cancer cells on different protein levels. The combination of such a marker array leads to higher and more specific discovery rates, predominantly in metastatic patients. Identification of CTCs by PCR methods may lead to better diagnosis and prognosis and could help to choose an adequate therapy.","1422-0067","International journal of molecular sciences","(14) 1093-104",2013,"Ulrich","Andergassen","U","Klinik und Poliklinik für Frauenheilkunde und Geburtshilfe Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitaet Muenchen, Campus Innenstadt, Maistraße 11, 80337 Munich, Germany. udo.jeschke@med.uni-muenchen.de."
23305553,"What is beyond a qRT-PCR study on mesenchymal stem cell differentiation properties: how to choose the most reliable housekeeping genes.","In the last years, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been identified as an attractive cell population in regenerative medicine. In view of future therapeutic applications, the study of specific differentiation-related gene expression is a pivotal prerequisite to define the most appropriate MSC source for clinical translation. In this context, it is crucial to use stable housekeeping genes (HGs) for normalization of qRT-PCR to obtain validated and comparable results. By our knowledge, an exhaustive validation study of HGs comparing MSCs from different sources under various differentiation conditions is still missing. In this pivotal study, we compared the expression levels of 12 genes (ACTB, Β2M, EF1alpha, GAPDH, GUSB, PPIA, RPL13A, RPLP0, TBP, UBC, YWHAZ and 18S rRNA) to assess their suitability as HGs in MSCs during adipogenic, osteogenic and chondrogenic differentiation. We demonstrated that many of the most popular HGs including 18S rRNA, B2M and ACTB were inadequate for normalization, whereas TBP/YWHAZ/GUSB were frequently identified among the best performers. Moreover, we showed the dramatic effects of suboptimal HGs choice on the quantification of cell differentiation markers, thus interfering with a reliable comparison of the lineage potential properties among various MSCs. Thus, in the emerging field of regenerative medicine, the identification of the most appropriate MSC source and cell line is so crucial for the treatment of patients that being inaccurate in the first step of the stem cell characterization can bring important consequences for the patients and for the promising potential of stem cell therapy.","1582-4934","Journal of cellular and molecular medicine","(17) 168-80",2013,"Enrico","Ragni","E","Cell Factory Franco Calori, Center for Transfusion Medicine, Cellular Therapy and Cryobiology, Department of Regenerative Medicine, Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milano, Italy."

We investigated the effects of ex vivo incubation of porcine colonic tissue on the quantity and quality of total RNA over a 12-h time period. Colonic tissue of pig (n = 6) was surgically removed immediately postslaughter and incubated for 0, 3, 6, and 12 h in a humidified cell culture incubator with 5% CO(2) at 37°C. Tissue samples were processed for RNA extraction. The quantity and quality of total RNA were assessed on a NanoDrop Spectrophotometer and an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer, respectively. Ex vivo incubation had an effect on both the quantity (P < 0.001) and quality (P < 0.001) of total RNA. Relative to the RNA yield at 0 h (505.0 ± 48.64 μg/mg), the yield was significantly reduced after 6 h (227.6 ± 25.52 μg/mg; P < 0.001) and 12 h (159.3 ± 24.19 μg/mg; P < 0.001) of incubation. The 28S and 18S rRNA bands were visibly intact after 0, 3, and 6 h of incubation. However, after 12 h of incubation, a degraded RNA profile was evident. The RNA integrity number (RIN) values for the 0, 3, 6, and 12 h of incubation were 9.4 ± 0.10, 9.0 ± 0.10, 6.7 ± 0.17 (P < 0.001), and 3.3 ± 0.24 (P < 0.001), respectively.

Little is known about the genes influencing its levels directly or through glomerular filtration rate (GFR). We conducted a genome-wide association study of plasma B2M levels in 6738 European Americans from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study to identify novel loci for B2M and assessed its association with known estimated GFR (eGFR) loci. We identified 2 genome-wide significant loci. One was in the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region on chromosome 6 (lowest p value = 1.8 × 10(-23) for rs9264638). At this locus, 6 index SNPs accounted for 3.2 % of log(B2M) variance, and their association with B2M could largely be explained by imputed classical alleles of the MHC class I genes: HLA-A, HLA-B, or HLA-C. The index SNPs at this locus were not associated with eGFR based on serum creatinine (eGFRcr). The other locus of B2M was on chromosome 12 (rs3184504 at SH2B3, beta = 0.02, p value = 3.1 × 10(-8)), which was previously implicated as an eGFR locus. In conclusion, although B2M is known to be a component of MHC class I molecule, the association between HLA class I alleles and plasma B2M levels in a community-based population is novel. The identification of the two novel loci for B2M extends our understanding of its metabolism and informs its use as a kidney filtration biomarker.","1432-1203","Human genetics","(132) 619-27",2013,"Adrienne","Tin","A","Department of Epidemiology, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, MD 21205, USA. atin@jhsph.edu"

However, due to antibody unavailability, immunological and pathological studies have not been adequately conducted in various disease models of common marmoset. Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) is a powerful tool to examine gene expression levels. Recent reports have shown that selection of internal reference housekeeping genes are required for accurate normalization of gene expression. To develop a reliable qPCR method in common marmoset, we used geNorm applets to evaluate the expression stability of eight candidate reference genes (GAPDH, ACTB, rRNA, B2M, UBC, HPRT, SDHA and TBP) in various tissues from laboratory common marmosets. geNorm analysis showed that GAPDH, ACTB, SDHA and TBP were generally ranked high in stability followed by UBC. In contrast, HPRT, rRNA and B2M exhibited lower expression stability than other genes in most tissues analyzed. Furthermore, by using the improved qPCR with selected reference genes, we analyzed the expression levels of CD antigens (CD3ε, CD4, CD8α and CD20) and cytokines (IL-1β, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12β, IL-13, IFN-γ and TNF-α) in peripheral blood leukocytes and compared them between common marmosets and humans. The expression levels of CD4 and IL-4 were lower in common marmosets than in humans whereas those of IL-10, IL-12β and IFN-γ were higher in the common marmoset. The ratio of Th1-related gene expression level to that of Th2-related genes was inverted in common marmosets. We confirmed the inverted ratio of CD4 to CD8 in common marmosets by flow cytometric analysis. Therefore, the difference in Th1/Th2 balance between common marmosets and humans may affect host defense and/or disease susceptibility, which should be carefully considered when using common marmoset as an experimental model for biomedical research.","1932-6203","PloS one","(8) e56296",2013,"Yoshiki","Fujii","Y","Department of Rheumatology and Clinical Immunology, Clinical Research Center for Allergy and Rheumatology, Sagamihara National Hospital, National Hospital Organization, Kanagawa, Japan."

The objective here was to test 16 well-known reference genes from different functional categories that could serve as suitable ICG during heat stress studies in buffalo mammary tissue. Briefly, the mammary explants were exposed to 45°C for 1 h and subsequently allowed to recover at 37°C for different time points (2-24 h). Three software programs, geNorm, Normfinder and BestKeeper, were used to measure gene transcript stability. RPL22 was excluded because of weak amplification and unacceptable PCR efficiency. Except GAPDH, all other genes showed expression stability within the acceptable range (<1.5). RPL4, B2M, RPS23 and EEF1A1 genes were found to be most stably expressed while GAPDH and ACTB showed least stability. The BestKeeper analysis identified high correlation for RPL4 (r=0.953) and EEF1A1 (r=0.914) with BestKeeper index. Based on the present findings, it could be suggested that geometric average of RPL4, B2M, RPS23 and EEF1A1 would provide accurate normalization to transcriptional data of buffalo mammary explant in response to heat stress.","1439-0388","Journal of animal breeding and genetics = Zeitschrift fur Tierzuchtung und Zuchtungsbiologie","(130) 106-17",2013,"M","Sodhi","M","National Bureau of Animal Genetic Resources, Karnal, Haryana, India."

23556086,"Treatment options for high-risk chronic lymphocytic leukaemia.","Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is the most common form of leukaemia in the Western world. The natural history of CLL is extremely variable with a survival time from initial diagnosis that ranges from 2 to more than 20 years. Understanding the clinical diversity and allowing the subclassification of CLL into various prognostic groups not only assists in predicting future outcome for patients, but also helps to direct treatment decisions. Chlorambucil and fludarabine were the standard therapy for CLL for decades. Randomized studies have reported superior overall response and progression-free survival (PFS) for fludarabine compared with alkylator-based therapy and for the fludarabine-cyclophospamide (FC) combination over fludarabine alone. More recently the addition of rituximab to the FC regimen (R-FC) has shown significant improvement in overall response, PFS and overall survival compared with FC alone. However, there are patients for whom this regimen still provides less satisfactory results. Within the above studies CLL patients who have some of the poorer prognostic markers, such as unmutated IgVH genes and/or high beta-2 microglobulin (B2M), and those who fail to achieve a minimal residual disease (MRD) negative remission are likely to have a shorter PFS compared with those without these features. Various strategies have been explored to improve the outcome for such patients. These include the addition of agents to a frontline R-FC regimen, use of consolidation and consideration of maintenance. The only group that can be clearly identified pretreatment for whom conventional fludarabine-based therapies produce significantly inferior response rates, PFS and overall survival are the patients who harbour a genetic fault; deletion or mutation or a combination of deletion and mutation of tumour protein p53 (TP53). TP53 inactivation is a less common finding at first treatment but becomes much more common in fludarabine-refractory patients. Alemtuzumab and high-dose corticosteroids have been shown to be effective in this group of CLL patients. Trials combining these two agents have shown improved responses, particularly for those patients with bulky nodal disease for whom alemtuzumab alone may be insufficient. Since the duration of responses remains relatively short, suitable patients should be considered for allogeneic stem cell transplantation according to the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) guidelines. Furthermore, there are a number of other new treatments on the horizon, including humanized antibodies directed against novel targets and small-molecule inhibitors.","2040-6207","Therapeutic advances in hematology","(2) 147-59",2011,"Saman","Hewamana","S","Department of Haemato-Oncology, The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust and The Institute of Cancer Research, Sutton, UK."

23601718,"The selection of endogenous genes in human postmortem tissues.","Precisely determining the postmortem interval (PMI), which is crucial to criminal and forensic cases, is a research in which quantitative RT-PCR (also known as qRT-PCR or real-time RT-PCR) has been used to analyse gene expression levels and data normalisation should be required to eliminate the differences among the samples. Therefore, it is quite necessary to find stable molecular biological markers in PMI determination research. In this study, we compared nine commonly used endogenous markers (containing ACTB, GAPDH, B2M, U6, 18S rRNA, hsa-mir-1, hsa-mir-9, hsa-mir-194-1 and hsa-mir-203) in the 109 human tissue samples obtained from autopsy at the aim of finding stable markers in human tissues with consideration of the impact of parameters (PMI and cause of death). After RNA was extracted from four tissues (heart, brain, kidney, skin), the Ct values of nine endogenous markers were obtained by qRT-PCR and assessed by geNorm software. The results showed that U6, GAPDH and 18S rRNA were the suitable markers in our set of samples in various corpse conditions, that B2M and ACTB were reliable internal controls in heart tissue only, and that microRNAs had such high M values that they should not be chosen for endogenous control genes.","1355-0306","Science & justice : journal of the Forensic Science Society","(53) 115-20",2013,"Heng","Zhang","H","Forensic Department, Fudan University, Shanghai, China. zhanghenghaha@gmail.com"
23629003,"HLA engineering of human pluripotent stem cells.","The clinical use of human pluripotent stem cells and their derivatives is limited by the rejection of transplanted cells due to differences in their human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes. This has led to the proposed use of histocompatible, patient-specific stem cells; however, the preparation of many different stem cell lines for clinical use is a daunting task. Here, we develop two distinct genetic engineering approaches that address this problem. First, we use a combination of gene targeting and mitotic recombination to derive HLA-homozygous embryonic stem cell (ESC) subclones from an HLA-heterozygous parental line. A small bank of HLA-homozygous stem cells with common haplotypes would match a significant proportion of the population. Second, we derive HLA class I-negative cells by targeted disruption of both alleles of the Beta-2 Microglobulin (B2M) gene in ESCs. Mixed leukocyte reactions and peptide-specific HLA-restricted CD8(+) T cell responses were reduced in class I-negative cells that had undergone differentiation in embryoid bodies. These B2M(-/-) ESCs could act as universal donor cells in applications where the transplanted cells do not express HLA class II genes. Both approaches used adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors for efficient gene targeting in the absence of potentially genotoxic nucleases, and produced pluripotent, transgene-free cell lines.","1525-0024","Molecular therapy : the journal of the American Society of Gene Therapy","(21) 1232-41",2013,"Laura","Riolobos","L","Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington 98195, USA."

Real-time quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) is an extremely sensitive technique that allows for the precise quantification of mRNA abundance; however, selecting stable reference genes suitable for the normalization of qRT-PCR data is required to avoid the misinterpretation of experimental results and erroneous analyses. This study employs several mouse models, including an early pregnancy, a pseudopregnancy, a delayed implantation and activation, an artificial decidualization and a hormonal treatment model; ten candidate reference genes (PPIA, RPLP0, HPRT1, GAPDH, ACTB, TBP, B2M, 18S, UBC and TUBA) that are found in uterine tissues were assessed for their suitability as internal controls for relative qRT-PCR quantification. GeNorm(PLUS), NormFinder, and BestKeeper were used to evaluate these candidate reference genes, and all of these methods identified RPLP0 and GAPDH as the most stable candidates and B2M and 18S as the least stable candidates.

We performed mRNA-Seq profiling on PBMCs from high and low antibody responders to rubella vaccination to delineate transcriptional differences upon viral stimulation. Generalized linear models were used to assess the per gene fold change (FC) for stimulated versus unstimulated samples or the interaction between outcome and stimulation. Model results were evaluated by both FC and p-value. Pathway analysis and self-contained gene set tests were performed for assessment of gene group effects. Of 17,566 detected genes, we identified 1,080 highly significant differentially expressed genes upon viral stimulation (p<1.00E(-15), FDR<1.00E(-14)), including various immune function and inflammation-related genes, genes involved in cell signaling, cell regulation and transcription, and genes with unknown function. Analysis by immune outcome and stimulation status identified 27 genes (p≤0.0006 and FDR≤0.30) that responded differently to viral stimulation in high vs. low antibody responders, including major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I genes (HLA-A, HLA-B and B2M with p = 0.0001, p = 0.0005 and p = 0.0002, respectively), and two genes related to innate immunity and inflammation (EMR3 and MEFV with p = 1.46E(-08) and p = 0.0004, respectively). Pathway and gene set analysis also revealed transcriptional differences in antigen presentation and innate/inflammatory gene sets and pathways between high and low responders.

The present study investigated the molecular pathology of brain damage and responses involving brain edema in forensic autopsy cases of fire fatality (n = 55) compared with sudden cardiac death (n = 11), mechanical asphyxia (n = 13), and non-brain injury cases (n = 22). Postmortem mRNA and immunohistochemical expressions of aquaporins (AQPs), claudin5 (CLDN5), and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) were examined. Prolonged deaths due to severe burns showed an increase in brain water content, but relative mRNA quantification, using different normalization methods, showed inconsistent results: in prolonged deaths due to severe burns, higher expression levels were detected for all markers when three previously validated reference genes, PES1, POLR2A, and IPO8, were used for normalization, higher for AQP1 and MMP9 when GAPDH alone was used for normalization and higher for MMP9, but lower for MMP2 when B2M alone was used for normalization. Additionally, when B2M alone was used for normalization, higher expression of AQP4 was detected in acute fire deaths. Furthermore, the expression stability values of these five reference genes calculated by geNorm demonstrated that B2M was the least stable one, followed by GAPDH. In immunostaining, only AQP1 and MMP9 showed differences among the causes of death: they were evident in most prolonged deaths due to severe burns. These findings suggest that systematic analysis of gene expressions using real-time PCR might be a useful procedure in forensic death investigation, and validation of reference genes is crucial.","1437-1596","International journal of legal medicine","(127) 881-9",2013,"Qi","Wang","Q","Department of Forensic Medicine, Southern Medical University, No. 1838, Guangzhou 510515, Guangdong Province, People's Republic of China. wangqi1980@live.com"

Initial screening was based on gene expression level (<28 Cq cycles) and variability (SD < 1.5 Cq cycles) and excluded TFRC, GYPC and HPRT from further analysis. Expression stability of the remaining genes was evaluated using four software programs: geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper and the comparative delta Cq method. The neutrophil reference genes, G6PD, YWHAZ, GAPDH, RPL19 and SDHA, consistently ranked among the top five most stable genes under these experimental conditions. The SDHA gene expression was not stable in FR-diseased sheep receiving Se treatment and, thus, cannot be recommended as a reference gene. The commonly used genes, PGK1, ACTB and B2M, were not reliable reference genes, underscoring the need to validate neutrophil reference genes under different experimental conditions. Multiple references genes rather than a single gene may provide more robust and reliable results.

Hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections were histologically graded using the Elston and Ellis grading method. MHC class I expression on tumor cells was evaluated using the avidin-biotin peroxidase complex method. Loss of MHC class I expression from canine mammary gland carcinomas was significantly correlated with poor prognosis (P<0.05). Loss of MHC class I expression showed no association with poor prognosis in canine mammary gland complex carcinomas, because the data were not balanced. Only 1 of 13 (7.6%) canine mammary gland complex carcinomas showed loss of MHC class I expression. All 13 of these dogs showed good prognosis. Thus, the low frequency of MHC class I expression loss from canine mammary gland complex carcinomas may be associated with good prognosis. Taken together, these results suggest that loss of MHC class I expression may be associated with poor prognosis in canine mammary gland carcinomas.

We have developed a qRT-PCR protocol that allows us to assay multiple gene products in small samples, starting at 100 cells and going down to a single cell, and have used it to study radiation responses at the single-cell level. Since the accuracy of qRT-PCR depends greatly on the choice of ""housekeeping"" genes used for normalization, initial studies concentrated on determining the optimal panel of such genes. Using an endogenous control array, it was found that for IMR90 cells, common housekeeping genes tend to fall into one of two categories-those that are relatively stably expressed regardless of the number of cells in the sample, e.g., B2M, PPIA, and GAPDH, and those that are more variable (again regardless of the size of the population), e.g., YWHAZ, 18S, TBP, and HPRT1. Further, expression levels in commonly studied radiation-response genes, such as ATF3, CDKN1A, GADD45A, and MDM2, were assayed in 100, 10, and single-cell samples. It is here that the value of single-cell analyses becomes apparent. It was observed that the expression of some genes such as FGF2 and MDM2 was relatively constant over all irradiated cells, while that of others such as FAS was considerably more variable. It was clear that almost all cells respond to ionizing radiation but the individual responses were considerably varied. The analyses of single cells indicate that responses in individual cells are not uniform and suggest that responses observed in populations are not indicative of identical patterns in all cells.

Furthermore, IMiD binding to CRBN is cytotoxic to multiple myeloma cells and absence of CRBN confers IMiDs resistance. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a potent pleiotropic cytokine that regulates plasma cell (PC) growth via the IL-6 receptor (IL-6R). IL-6/IL-6R autocrine activity is implicated in the development and progression of cancers including cervical cancer, prostate cancer, and multiple myeloma. The aim of the study was to evaluate CRBN and IL-6R expressions and their impact on clinical efficacy of dexamethasone-thalidomide therapy in multiple myeloma (MM) patients, in addition to their association with other clinical and prognostic parameters. Forty-six newly diagnosed MM patients were enrolled in the study. We measured CRBN expression prior to therapy initiation by real-time polymerase chain reaction in 46 bone marrow (BM) aspiration samples of patients and controls. In addition, IL-6R expression was evaluated on BM biopsies of patients and controls by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Twenty-eight males (60.9%) and 18 females (39.1%) were enrolled. The mean age was 65.11 ± 7.3 yr (range 39-77 yr). Median CRBN expression in 46 BM samples of MM patients was significantly higher than in controls (P < 0.001). Among established prognostic parameters, international staging system (ISS), serum beta-2-microglobulin (B2M), and serum albumin correlated reversely with CRBN expression. IL-6R expression was significantly higher in patients than in controls. IL-6R expression was significantly associated with response to treatment (P < 0.001), B2M (P = 0.032), and ISS (P = 0.028). Strong intensity expression was associated with low CRBN expression (P = 0.001).In conclusion, CRBN expression may provide a biomarker to predict response to IMiD in patients with MM and its high expression can serve as a marker of good prognosis. Strong IL-6R expression is associated with poor response to therapy in multiple myeloma patients and may be used as a prognostic marker.

24123810,"A site-specific genetic modification for induction of pluripotency and subsequent isolation of derived lung alveolar epithelial type II cells.","Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) have great therapeutic potential in repairing defective lung alveoli. However, genetic abnormalities caused by vector integrations and low efficiency in generating hiPSCs, as well as difficulty in obtaining transplantable hiPSC-derived cell types are still major obstacles. Here we report a novel strategy using a single nonviral site-specific targeting vector with a combination of Tet-On inducible gene expression system, Cre/lox P switching gene expression system, and alveolar epithelial type II cell (ATIIC)-specific Neomycin(R) transgene expression system. With this strategy, a single copy of all of the required transgenes can be specifically knocked into a site immediately downstream of β-2-microglobulin (B2M) gene locus at a high frequency, without causing B2M dysfunction. Thus, the expression of reprogramming factors, Oct4, Sox2, cMyc, and Klf4, can be precisely regulated for efficient reprogramming of somatic cells into random integration-free or genetic mutation-free hiPSCs. The exogenous reprogramming factor transgenes can be subsequently removed after reprogramming by transient expression of Cre recombinase, and the resulting random integration-free and exogenous reprogramming factor-free hiPSCs can be selectively differentiated into a homogenous population of ATIICs. In addition, we show that these hiPSC-derived ATIICs exhibit ultrastructural characteristics and biological functions of normal ATIICs. When transplanted into bleomycin-challenged mice lungs, hiPSC-derived ATIICs efficiently remain and re-epithelialize injured alveoli to restore pulmonary function, preventing lung fibrosis and increasing survival without tumorigenic side effect. This strategy allows for the first time efficient generation of patient-specific ATIICs for possible future clinical applications.","1549-4918","Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)","(32) 402-13",2014,"Qing","Yan","Q","The Brown Foundation Institute of Molecular Medicine for the Prevention of Human Diseases, University of Texas Medical School at Houston, Houston, Texas, USA."
24134324,"Comparison of cystatin C and Beta-2-microglobulin kinetics in children on maintenance hemodialysis.","Middle-molecules (MM) are not monitored in children on hemodialysis (HD), but are accumulated and increase the risk of cardiovascular disease and mortality. Molecular properties of Cystatin C (CyC), 13 kDa, potentially make it a preferred MM marker over Beta-2-Microglobulin (B2M), 12 kDa. We compared CyC and B2M kinetics to investigate if CyC can be used as preferred MM marker. CyC (mg/L) and B2M (μg/mL) were measured in 21 low-flux HD sessions in seven children. Blood samples were taken at HD start (pre), 1 and 2 hours into HD and at end of HD (post) for all sessions and 60 minutes after the first HD (Eq). PreCyC (9.85 ± 2.15) did not differ (P > 0.05) from postCyC (10.04 ± 2.83). PostB2M (38.87 ± 7.12) was higher (P < 0.05) than preHD B2M (33.27 ± 7.41). There was no change in CyC at 1 and 2 hours into HD, while B2M progressively increased. CyC or B2M changes did not significantly correlate with spKt/V (2.09 ± 0.86), ultrafiltration (4.61 ± 1.98%) or HD duration (218 ± 20 minutes). EqCyC was not different from postCyC (11.07 ± 3.14 vs. 10.71 ± 2.85, P > 0.05), while EqB2M was lower than postB2M (36.48 ± 7.68 vs. 41.09 ± 8.99, P < 0.05). MMs as represented by B2M and CyC are elevated in children on standard HD. Intensified HD modalities would be needed for their removal. B2M is affected by the dialytic process with a rise during HD independent of ultrafiltration and decrease 1 hour after, while CyC remains unchanged. We suggest that CyC be used as preferred marker of MM removal and as a marker of adequacy of intensified HD regimens.","1542-4758","Hemodialysis international.

24145116,"Family-specific differences in growth rate and hepatic gene expression in juvenile triploid growth hormone (GH) transgenic Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar).","Growth hormone transgenic (GHTg) Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) have enhanced growth when compared to their non-transgenic counterparts, and this trait can be beneficial for aquaculture production. Biological confinement of GHTg Atlantic salmon may be achieved through the induction of triploidy (3N). The growth rates of triploid GH transgenic (3NGHTg) Atlantic salmon juveniles were found to significantly vary between families in the AquaBounty breeding program. In order to characterize gene expression associated with enhanced growth in juvenile 3NGHTg Atlantic salmon, a functional genomics approach (32K cDNA microarray hybridizations followed by QPCR) was used to identify and validate liver transcripts that were differentially expressed between two fast-growing 3NGHTg Atlantic salmon families (AS11, AS26) and a slow-growing 3NGHTg Atlantic salmon family (AS25); juvenile growth rate was evaluated over a 45-day period. Of 687 microarray-identified differentially expressed features, 143 (116 more highly expressed in fast-growing and 27 more highly expressed in slow-growing juveniles) were identified in the AS11 vs. AS25 microarray study, while 544 (442 more highly expressed in fast-growing and 102 more highly expressed in slow-growing juveniles) were identified in the AS26 vs. AS25 microarray study. Forty microarray features (39 putatively associated with fast growth and 1 putatively associated with slow growth) were present in both microarray experiment gene lists. The expression levels of 15 microarray-identified transcripts were studied using QPCR with individual RNA samples to validate microarray results and to study biological variability of transcript expression. The QPCR results agreed with the microarray results for 12 of 13 putative fast-growth associated transcripts, but QPCR did not validate the microarray results for 2 putative slow-growth associated transcripts. Many of the 39 microarray-identified genes putatively associated at the transcript expression level with fast-growing 3NGHTg salmon juveniles (including APOA1, APOA4, B2M, FADSD6, FTM, and GAPDH) are involved in metabolism, iron homeostasis and oxygen transport, and immune- or stress-related responses. The results of this study increase our knowledge of family-specific impacts on growth rate and hepatic gene expression in juvenile 3NGHTg Atlantic salmon. In addition, this study provides a suite of putative rapid growth rate-associated transcripts that may contribute to the development of molecular markers [e.g. intronic, exonic or regulatory region single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)] for the selection of GHTg Atlantic salmon broodstock that can be utilized to produce sterile triploids of desired growth performance for future commercial applications.

24173087,"A highly specific q-RT-PCR assay to address the relevance of the JAK2WT and JAK2V617F expression levels and control genes in Ph-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms.","In Ph- myeloproliferative neoplasms, the quantification of the JAK2V617F transcripts may provide some advantages over the DNA allele burden determination. We developed a q-RT-PCR to assess the JAK2WT and JAK2V617F mRNA expression in 105 cases (23 donors, 13 secondary polycythemia, 22 polycythemia vera (PV), 38 essential thrombocythemia (ET), and 9 primary myelofibrosis (PMF)). Compared with the standard allele-specific oligonucleotide (ASO)-PCR technique, our assay showed a 100 % concordance rate detecting the JAK2V617F mutation in 22/22 PV (100 %), 29/38 (76.3 %) ET, and 5/9 (55.5 %) PMF cases, respectively. The sensitivity of the assay was 0.01 %. Comparing DNA and RNA samples, we found that the JAK2V617F mutational ratios were significantly higher at the RNA level both in PV (p = 0.005) and ET (p = 0.001) samples. In PV patients, JAK2WT expression levels positively correlated with the platelets (PLTs) (p = 0.003) whereas a trend to negative correlation was observed with the Hb levels (p = 0.051). JAK2V617F-positive cases showed the lowest JAK2WT and ABL1 mRNA expression levels. In all the samples, the expression pattern of beta-glucoronidase (GUSB) was more homogeneous than that of ABL1 or β2 microglobulin (B2M). Using GUSB as normalizator gene, a significant increase of the JAK2V617F mRNA levels was seen in two ET patients at time of progression to PV. In conclusion, the proposed q-RT-PCR is a sensitive and accurate method to quantify the JAK2 mutational status that can also show clinical correlations suggesting the impact of the residual amount of the JAK2WT allele on the Ph- MPN disease phenotype. Our observations also preclude the use of ABL1 as a housekeeping gene for these neoplasms.","1432-0584","Annals of hematology","(93) 609-16",2014,"Francesca","Fantasia","F","Department of Medico-Surgical Sciences and Biotechnologies, University of Rome ""Sapienza"" Polo Pontino, , Latina, Italy."

It showed that sIL-2Rα level ≥ 115 pmol/L at the time of treatment initiation correlated with a high Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index-2 (FLIPI-2), bulky disease, advanced clinical stage, number of involved lymph nodes, bone marrow involvement and elevated β2-microglobulin (B2M) level. When testing all patients, sIL-2Rα ≥ 115 pmol/L was associated with significantly shorter progression-free (PFS; p < 0.03, hazard ratio [HR] 2.04) but not overall (OS; p = 0.06, HR 2.36) survival rates. Subanalysis of patients receiving cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone (CHOP) ± rituximab showed higher predictive power for both PFS (HR 2.75, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.24-6.11, p = 0.01) and OS (HR 3.33, 95% CI 1.15-9.63, p = 0.02). In the whole population (n = 100), only B2M proved a significant univariate predictor (p = 0.007, HR = 2.8) of PFS. When testing patients treated with CHOP ± rituximab, sIL-2Rα was found to be the best univariate predictor for PFS among all FLIPI-2 factors (HR = 2.68, p = 0.015). Serum IL-2Rα levels may help to refine risk assessment in the modern immunotherapy era complementary to FLIPI-2 factors.","1029-2403","Leukemia & lymphoma","(55) 1584-90",2014,"Vít","Procházka","V","Department of Hemato-Oncology, Palacky University , Olomouc , Czech Republic."
24196629,"[Pathogenesis of microsatellite-unstable colorectal cancer. Evaluation of new diagnostic and therapeutic options].","The molecular pathogenesis of colorectal cancer is heterogeneous. Whereas the majority of colorectal cancers follow the classical adenoma-carcinoma sequence and display chromosomal instability, a subset of approximately 15 % of colorectal cancers show a deficiency of the DNA mismatch repair system. These carcinomas present with numerous mutations at repetitive DNA stretches, a phenotype termed high-level microsatellite instability (MSI-H). The pathogenesis of MSI-H cancers is driven by mismatch repair deficiency-induced insertion/deletion mutations affecting microsatellites located in the coding region of tumor suppressor genes, such as TGFBR2. The MSI-induced mutations of tumor suppressor genes not only lead to functional inactivation but also to shifts of the translational reading frame and consequently to the generation of frameshift peptides (FSPs). These FSPs can be recognized as foreign by the host immune system. It could be shown that in the majority of MSI-H colorectal cancer patients, FSP-specific T cell-mediated immune responses can be detected. These tumor antigen-specific immune responses are regarded as a major reason for the dense local lymphocyte infiltration which is typical of MSI-H colorectal cancer. A further characteristic feature of MSI-H cancers is the occurrence of alterations affecting the cellular antigen presentation mechanism where beta2-microglobulin (B2M) mutations that directly result from DNA mismatch repair deficiency represent the most common mechanism. It could be demonstrated that B2M mutations are associated with M0 stage and a very favorable prognosis. The characterization of the particular immunological properties of MSI-H tumors have paved the way for the initiation of a clinical trial in which FSP vaccination is currently being clinically evaluated in patients with MSI-H colorectal cancer.

They ultimately serve as a control in RT-qPCR analysis, producing more accurate interpretation of results. Whereas many reference genes have been used in various wound-healing studies, the most stable reference gene for ischemic wound-healing analysis has yet to be identified. The goal of this study was to determine systematically the most stable reference gene for studying gene expression in a rat ischemic wound-healing model using RT-qPCR. Twelve commonly used reference genes were analyzed using RT-qPCR and geNorm data analysis to determine stability across normal and ischemic skin tissue. It was ultimately determined that Ubiquitin C (UBC) and β-2 Microglobulin (B2M) are the most stably conserved reference genes across normal and ischemic skin tissue. UBC and B2M represent reliable reference genes for RT-qPCR studies in the rat ischemic wound model and are unaffected by sustained tissue ischemia. The geometric mean of these two stable genes provides an accurate normalization factor. These results provide insight on dependence of reference-gene stability on experimental parameters and the importance of such reference-gene investigations.

The task was to identify dried menstrual blood and vaginal secretion stains using specific RNA biomarkers, and additionally test 3 housekeeping genes for their suitability as reference genes. Six menstrual blood and six vaginal secretion stains, two dilution series (1/4-1/64 pieces of a menstrual blood/vaginal swab) and, optionally, bona fide or mock casework samples of human or non-human origin were analyzed by 24 participating laboratories, using RNA extraction or RNA/DNA co-extraction methods. Two novel menstrual blood mRNA multiplexes were used: MMP triplex (MMP7, MMP10, MMP11) and MB triplex (MSX1, LEFTY2, SFRP4) in conjunction with a housekeeping gene triplex (B2M, UBC, UCE). Two novel mRNA multiplexes and a HBD1 singleplex were used for the identification of vaginal secretion: Vag triplex (MYOZ1, CYP2B7P1 and MUC4) and a Lactobacillus-specific Lacto triplex (Ljen, Lcris, Lgas). The laboratories used different chemistries and instrumentation and all were able to successfully isolate and detect mRNA in dried stains. The simultaneous extraction of RNA and DNA allowed for positive identification of the tissue/fluid source of origin by mRNA profiling as well as a simultaneous identification of the body fluid donor by STR profiling, also from old and compromised casework samples. The results of this and the previous collaborative RNA exercises support RNA profiling as a reliable body fluid identification method that can easily be combined with current STR typing technology.

Data normalization is essential to correct for potential errors incurred in all steps from RNA isolation to PCR amplification. The commonly accepted approach for normalization is the use of reference gene. Until now, no suitable reference genes have been available for data normalization of gene expression in milk somatic cells of lactating yaks across lactation. In the present study, we evaluated the transcriptional stability of 10 candidate reference genes in milk somatic cells of lactating yak, including ACTB, B2M, GAPDH, GTP, MRPL39, PPP1R11, RPS9, RPS15, UXT, and RN18S1. Four genes, RPS9, PPP1R11, UXT, and MRPL39, were identified as being the most stable genes in milk somatic cells of lactating yak. Using the combination of RPS9, PPP1R11, UXT, and MRPL39 as reference genes, we further assessed the relative expression of 4 genes of interest in milk somatic cells of yak across lactation, including ELF5, ABCG2, SREBF2, and DGAT1. Compared with expression in colostrum, the overall transcription levels of ELF5, ABCG2, and SREBF2 in milk were found to be significantly upregulated in early, peak, and late lactation, and significantly downregulated thereafter, before the dry period. A similar pattern was observed in the relative expression of DGAT1, but no significant difference was revealed in its expression in milk from late lactation compared with colostrum. Based on these results, we suggest that the geometric mean of RPS9, PPP1R11, UXT, and MRPL39 can be used for normalization of real-time PCR data in milk somatic cells of lactating yak, if similar experiments are performed.

We used six different software programs for ranking of reference genes and found that individual rankings of the genes differed among them. Additionally, there was a significant difference in ranking patterns of the studied genes among different tissues. A rank aggregation method was applied to combine the ranking lists of the six programs to a consensus ranking. Our results revealed that HSP-90 was nearly always among the two most stable genes in all studied tissues.

The geNorm results revealed that PGK1, ACTB, and RPL4 exhibit high expression stability in all of the samples, and the NormFinder results indicated that GAPDH is the most stable gene. Furthermore, the BestKeeper results indicated that the three most stable genes are PPIA, GAPDH, and RPL4 and that S18, B2M and BLM are the three least stable genes. There are a number of differences in the ranking order of the reference genes obtained using the different algorithms. In conclusion, GAPDH, RPL4, and PPIA were the three most stable genes in frozen boar spermatozoa, as determined based on the cycle threshold coefficient of variation (Ct CV%) and the comprehensive ranking order, and this finding is consistent with the BestKeeper results.

Among them, a total of 101 patients were included in the analysis, with exclusion of patients without baseline serum B2M level and those did not receive anticancer therapy. Serum B2M (<3.0 vs. ≥3.0 mg/L) was analyzed for association with overall survival (OS). Seventy-nine (78 %) patients had nasal ENKTL, and 22 (22 %) had extranasal ENKTL. In overall patients, median OS was 26.7 months (95 % confidence interval (CI), not assessable), with a median follow-up of 32.4 months (range, 0.9-155.2 months).

Tumor persistence or recurrence after NY-ESO-1-specific therapy occurs, however, and the mechanisms of recurrence remain poorly defined. In a murine xenograft model of NY-ESO-1(+) multiple myeloma, we observed tumor recurrence after adoptive transfer of CD8(+) T cells genetically redirected to the prototypic NY-ESO-1157-165 peptide presented by HLA-A*02:01. Analysis of the myeloma cells that had escaped from T-cell control revealed intact expression of NY-ESO-1 and B2M, but selective, complete loss of HLA-A*02:01 expression from the cell surface. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) involving the HLA-A locus was identified in the tumor cells, and further analysis revealed selective loss of the allele encoding HLA-A*02:01. Although LOH involving the MHC has not been described in myeloma patients with persistent or recurrent disease after immune therapies such as allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), it has been described in patients with acute myelogenous leukemia who relapsed after allogeneic HCT.

To validate the RNA-Seq dataset, we used qRT-PCR to verify the expression levels of these 20 genes in a separate set of 100 pairs of normal lung tissue and lung squamous-cell carcinoma samples, and then analyzed these results using geNorm and NormFinder. With respect to 14 of the 15 common reference genes (B2M, GAPDH, GUSB, HMBS, HPRT1, IPO8, PGK1, POLR2A, PPIA, RPLP0, TBP, TFRC, UBC, and YWHAZ), the expression levels were either too low to be easily detected, or exhibited a high degree of variability either between lung normal and squamous-cell carcinoma samples, or even among samples of the same tissue type. In contrast, 1 of the 15 common reference genes (ACTB) and the 5 additional candidate reference genes (EEF1A1, FAU, RPS9, RPS11, and RPS14) were stably and constitutively expressed at high levels in all the samples tested. ACTB, EEF1A1, FAU, RPS9, RPS11, and RPS14 are ideal reference genes for qRT-PCR analysis of lung squamous-cell carcinoma, while 14 commonly used qRT-PCR reference genes are less appropriate in this context.

Although several genes are commonly used as reference genes (such as GAPDH, ACTB, and 18S rRNA), they are also regulated and can be expressed at varying levels. In this study, we evaluated twelve well-known reference genes to identify the most suitable housekeeping gene for normalization of qRT-PCR in human lumbar vertebral endplate with Modic changes, by using the geNorm, NormFinder, and BestKeeper algorithms. Our results showed that the rarely-used SDHA was the most stable single reference gene, and a combination of three, SDHA, B2M, and LDHA, was the most suitable gene set for normalization in all samples. In addition, the commonly-used genes, GAPDH, ACTB and 18S rRNA, were all inappropriate as internal standards. The rankings of reference genes for the three types of Modic change differed, although SDHA and RPL13A uniformly ranked in the first and last position, respectively. Further simulated expression analysis validated that the arbitrary use of a reference gene could lead to the misinterpretation of data. Our study confirmed the necessity of exploring the expression stability of potential reference genes in each specific tissue and experimental situation before quantitative evaluation of gene expression by qRT-PCR.

24626784,"Identification of suitable reference genes for quantitative RT-PCR during 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation.","Quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) is becoming increasingly important in the effort to gain insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying adipogenesis. However, the expression profile of a target gene may be misinterpreted due to the unstable expression of the reference genes under different experimental conditions. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the expression stability of 10 commonly used reference genes during 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation. The mRNA expression levels of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and transferrin receptor (TFRC) significantly increased during the course of 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation, which was decreased by berberine, an inhibitor of adipogenesis. Three popular algorithms, GeNorm, NormFinder and BestKeeper, identified 18 ribosomal RNA and hydroxymethylbilane synthase (HMBS) as the most stable reference genes, while GAPDH and TFRC were the least stable ones. Peptidylprolyl isomerase A [PIPA (cyclophilin A)], ribosomal protein, large, P0 (36-B4), beta-2-microglobulin (B2M), α1-tubulin, hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) and β-actin showed relatively stable expression levels. The choice of reference genes with various expression stabilities exerted a profound influence on the expression profiles of 2 target genes, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)γ2 and C/EBPα. In addition, western blot analysis revealed that the increased protein expression of GAPDH was markedly inhibited by berberine during adipocyte differentiation. This study highlights the importance of selecting suitable reference genes for qRT-PCR studies of gene expression during the process of adipogenesis.","1791-244X","International journal of molecular medicine","(33) 1209-18",2014,"Juan","Zhang","J","Shanghai Institute of Endocrine and Metabolic Diseases, Department of Endocrine and Metabolic Diseases, Shanghai Clinical Center for Endocrine and Metabolic Diseases, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200025, P.R.

24648917,"β-2 microglobulin is unsuitable as an internal reference gene for the analysis of gene expression in human colorectal cancer.","It is well-known that gene expression levels should be normalized to a carefully selected and appropriately stable internal control gene. However, numerous studies have demonstrated that the expression of housekeeping (HK) genes, typically used as internal control genes varies considerably. A number of studies have shown that β-2 microglobulin (B2M), an HK gene, frequently used as an internal reference gene, is expressed at low levels in colorectal cancer tissue, when assessed using real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Due to the fact that the expression levels of various HK genes vary depending on the tissue type or experimental conditions, it has been suggested that several control genes should be analyzed in parallel for certain tissues. In the present study, mRNA expression levels of toll-like receptors 2 (TLR2) and 4 (TLR4) in sporadic human colorectal cancerous and non-cancerous tissues were analyzed relative to three HK genes, β-glucuronidase (GUS), β-actin (BA) and B2M, using a commercially available tool. Relative expression levels were quantified using the three genes individually and together, and TLR2 as well as TLR4 expression was compared in cancerous and non-cancerous colorectal tissue specimens. Consistent data were obtained in most cases when GUS and BA were used as internal control genes. When B2M was used as the internal control gene, TLR2 and TLR4 expression was demonstrated to be higher in cancerous compared to non-cancerous colorectal tissues. These results were consistent with previous observations of low-level B2M expression in cancerous colorectal tissue and suggest that B2M may be inappropriate as an internal control gene for gene expression studies of colorectal cancer.","2049-9434","Biomedical reports","(1) 193-196",2013,"Yasuhiro","Nihon-Yanagi","Y","Division of Hematology, Respiratory Medicine and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Saga University, Saga 849-8501;"

To date, no reference genes have been screened in the half-smooth tongue sole (Cynoglossus semilaevis). The aim of this study was to select the most stable genes for quantitative real-time RT-PCR. Eight housekeeping genes (18S, TUBA, B2M, ACTB, EF1A, GAPDH, RPL17 and UBCE) were tested at different developmental stages, in different tissues, and following exposure to the drug SB-431542. Using geNorm, BestKeeper and NormFinder software, GAPDH/B2M, GAPDH/18S and UBCE/GAPDH were identified as the most suitable genes from samples taken of different developmental stages while 18S/RPL17 were consistently ranked as the best reference genes for different tissue types.

The current study utilized lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) derived from patients with mood disorders to investigate the effects of a range of doses of lithium (0, 1, 2 and 5 mM) and sodium valproate (0, 0.06, 0.03 and 0.6 mM) on the stability of 12 housekeeping genes. RNA was extracted from LCLs and qPCR was used to generate cycle threshold (Ct ) values which were input into RefFinder analyses. The study revealed drug-specific effects on housekeeping gene stability. The most stable housekeeping genes in LCLs treated: acutely with sodium valproate were ACTB and RPL13A; acutely with lithium were GAPDH and ATP5B; chronically with lithium were ATP5B and CYC1. The stability of GAPDH and B2M were particularly affected by duration of lithium treatment.

Ten house keeping genes were evaluated by using geNorm 3.4 excel based application. The most stable genes were RPL27, ACTB and B2M which were subsequently used for calculating the normalization factor. Under pretreatment conditions (4 h probiotic treatment, followed by lipopolysaccharide challenge for 3 h), all the three strains evoked downregulation of IL-8 expression by ~100 %, while in case of TNF-α, the downregulation of the relative gene expression was at the rate of 98.2, 93.8 and 98.0 % with Lp5276, Lp9 and Lp91, respectively, under the same set of conditions. Lp91 evoked maximum downregulation of IL12p35 and IFN-γ with corresponding fold reduction in relative expression of the two genes by 96.5 and 96.7 % during pre-treatment conditions. However, IL-10 and IFN-α were significantly upregulated to the extent of 8.13 ± 0.36 and 2.62 ± 0.14 fold by Lp91 under the same conditions.

We aim to evaluate the effects of thawing at room temperature for different time periods on gene expression analysis. A time course study with four time points was conducted to investigate the expression profiling on 10 thawed normal mice renal tissue samples through Affymetrix GeneChip mouse gene 2.0 st array. Microarray results were validated by quantitative real time polymerase chain reactions (qPCR) on 6 candidate reference genes and 11 target genes. Additionally, we used geNorm plus and NormFinder to identify the most stably expressed reference genes over time. The results showed RNA degraded more after longer incubation at room temperature. However, microarray results showed only 240 genes (0.91%) altered significantly in response to thawing at room temperature. The signal of majority altered probe sets decreased with thawing time, and the crossing point (Cp) values of all candidate reference genes correlated positively with the thawing time (p<0.05). The combination of B2M, ACTB and PPIA was identified as the best choice for qPCR normalization. We found most target genes were stable by using this normalization method. However, serious gene quantification errors were resulted from improper reference genes. In conclusion, thirty minutes of thawing at room temperature has a limited impact on microarray and qPCR analysis, gene expression variations due to RNA degradation in early period after thawing can be largely reduced by proper normalization.

The system of Fas with its ligand (Fas-L) participates actively in the extrinsic apoptotic system. In oncology, its role is controversial, since it has been reported both to suppress and promote tumor growth. The aim of this study was to measure serum levels of soluble Fas-L (sFas-L) in patients with active MM and to correlate them with markers of disease activity. We studied 57 patients with active MM, along with 22 healthy controls. We measured serum levels of sFas-L and interleukin-6 (IL-6) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, as well of beta-2 microglobulin (B2M), C-reactive protein (CRP) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). We also measured the degree of bone marrow infiltration. All parameters were increased in patients, compared with controls (p < 0.001 for all cases) and also in parallel with disease stage (p < 0.001 for all cases). Positive correlations were noted between serum levels of sFas-L with IL-6, infiltration (p < 0.001 for both cases) and LDH (p < 0.04), but not with CRP and B2M. We suggest that the system of Fas/Fas-L participates actively in MM progression in a complex manner and that serum levels of sFas-L may reflect disease progression.

Therefore, to investigate the potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets for epithelial ovarian cancer by qPCR, it is critical to identify stable reference genes. In this study, twelve housekeeping genes (ACTB, GAPDH, 18S rRNA, GUSB, PPIA, PBGD, PUM1, TBP, HRPT1, RPLP0, RPL13A, and B2M) were analyzed in 50 ovarian samples from normal, benign, borderline, and malignant tissues. For reliable results, laser microdissection (LMD), an effective technique used to prepare homogeneous starting material, was utilized to precisely excise target tissues or cells. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and nonparametric (Kruskal-Wallis) tests were used to compare the expression differences. NormFinder and geNorm software were employed to further validate the suitability and stability of the candidate genes. Results showed that epithelial cells occupied a small percentage of the normal ovary indeed. The expression of ACTB, PPIA, RPL13A, RPLP0, and TBP were stable independent of the disease progression. In addition, NormFinder and geNorm identified the most stable combination (ACTB, PPIA, RPLP0, and TBP) and the relatively unstable reference gene GAPDH from the twelve commonly used housekeeping genes. Our results highlight the use of homogeneous ovarian tissues and multiple-reference normalization strategy, e.g. the combination of ACTB, PPIA, RPLP0, and TBP, for qPCR in epithelial ovarian tissues, whereas GAPDH, the most commonly used reference gene, is not recommended, especially as a single reference gene.

Proteomics is the systematic study of a proteome, which is the total protein content of a cell, organism or body fluids. Application of proteomic technologies in nephrology has enabled more detailed analyses of protein functions and examined their importance in various physiological and pathological states. Biomarkers with high specificity and sensitivity to early diagnosis are needed for a better understanding of the mechanisms of EN development and its consequences. Urine beta2-microglobulin (B2M) was mainly used as a tubular marker of EN but recently alpha1-microglobulin (AMBP) was proposed for the diagnosis of EN. We studied the urine proteins of 360 patients with EN, diabetic nephropathy (DN) and acute kidney injury (AKI) and the healthy population using proteomic tools. Protein maps from the urine of patients with EN showed significant differences in comparison to the healthy subjects and patients with DN and AKI. Our study highlights six proteins in urine that were differentially excreted in the urine of EN patients compared with the other groups and have potential to be markers for EN prediction. In one of our studies, using routine biomarkers, we investigated the potential of urine B2M, AMBP, albumin and total protein as diagnostic markers for EN, in comparison to glomerulonephritis, nephrosclerosis and a healthy state. Modern proteomic technologies are still robust investigation tools, but can access a vast amount of information from one set of experiments in comparison to a classic diagnostic approach.","1857-9345","Prilozi (Makedonska akademija na naukite i umetnostite.

Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) is a standard method for quantification of gene expression studies. However, the reliability of qRT-PCR data critically depends on proper selection of reference genes. In the study, using two different analysis programs, geNorm and NormFinder, we systematically evaluated the gene expression stability of six candidate reference genes (GAPDH, ACTB, B2M, RPL4, TBP, and PPIA) in samples of whole blood and PBMC with or without poly I:C stimulation. Generally, the six candidate genes performed a similar trend of expression stability in the samples of whole blood and PBMC, but more stably expressed in whole blood than in PBMC. geNorm ranked B2M and PPIA as the best combination for gene expression normalization, while according to NormFinder, TBP was ranked as the most stable reference gene, followed by B2M and PPIA. Comprehensively considering the results from the two programs, we recommended using the geometric mean of the three genes, TBP, PPIA and B2M, to normalize the gene expression of whole blood and PBMC with poly I:C stimulation.

However, the incidence of RI and renal response to treatment are variable depending on their definition. A total of 379 patients newly-diagnosed and treated for symptomatic myeloma at the Samsung Medical Center between January 2000 and December 2011 were retrospectively reviewed. RI and renal response were assessed according to the recent International working group (IMWG) recommendations. Out of the 379 patients, renal insufficiency was present in 117 (30.8%) and was associated with adverse clinical parameters such as anemia, elevated beta-2 microglobulin (B2M), elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), hypercalcemia, and more advanced disease by the International Staging System (ISS). Out of the 85 patients who were evaluable for renal response, 58 (68.2%) showed renal response and 46 (54%) had major renal response. Less advanced disease by the International Staging System and inclusion of high-dose dexamethasone as first-line treatment were independently predictive for major renal response. Median time-to-renal response was 5.5 months, and bortezomib-containing regimen, high-dose dexamethasone, and less advanced stage disease were associated with a more rapid renal response.","1791-7530","Anticancer research","(34) 4299-306",2014,"Silvia","Park","S","Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Medicine, Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul, South Korea."
25122470,"Identification of suitable reference genes for gene expression studies of shoulder instability.","Shoulder instability is a common shoulder injury, and patients present with plastic deformation of the glenohumeral capsule. Gene expression analysis may be a useful tool for increasing the general understanding of capsule deformation, and reverse-transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) has become an effective method for such studies. Although RT-qPCR is highly sensitive and specific, it requires the use of suitable reference genes for data normalization to guarantee meaningful and reproducible results. In the present study, we evaluated the suitability of a set of reference genes using samples from the glenohumeral capsules of individuals with and without shoulder instability. We analyzed the expression of six commonly used reference genes (ACTB, B2M, GAPDH, HPRT1, TBP and TFRC) in the antero-inferior, antero-superior and posterior portions of the glenohumeral capsules of cases and controls. The stability of the candidate reference gene expression was determined using four software packages: NormFinder, geNorm, BestKeeper and DataAssist. Overall, HPRT1 was the best single reference gene, and HPRT1 and B2M composed the best pair of reference genes from different analysis groups, including simultaneous analysis of all tissue samples. GenEx software was used to identify the optimal number of reference genes to be used for normalization and demonstrated that the accumulated standard deviation resulting from the use of 2 reference genes was similar to that resulting from the use of 3 or more reference genes. To identify the optimal combination of reference genes, we evaluated the expression of COL1A1. Although the use of different reference gene combinations yielded variable normalized quantities, the relative quantities within sample groups were similar and confirmed that no obvious differences were observed when using 2, 3 or 4 reference genes. Consequently, the use of 2 stable reference genes for normalization, especially HPRT1 and B2M, is a reliable method for evaluating gene expression by RT-qPCR.

25144566,"Genetic variation in iron metabolism is associated with neuropathic pain and pain severity in HIV-infected patients on antiretroviral therapy.","HIV sensory neuropathy and distal neuropathic pain (DNP) are common, disabling complications associated with combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). We previously associated iron-regulatory genetic polymorphisms with a reduced risk of HIV sensory neuropathy during more neurotoxic types of cART. We here evaluated the impact of polymorphisms in 19 iron-regulatory genes on DNP in 560 HIV-infected subjects from a prospective, observational study, who underwent neurological examinations to ascertain peripheral neuropathy and structured interviews to ascertain DNP. Genotype-DNP associations were explored by logistic regression and permutation-based analytical methods. Among 559 evaluable subjects, 331 (59%) developed HIV-SN, and 168 (30%) reported DNP. Fifteen polymorphisms in 8 genes (p<0.05) and 5 variants in 4 genes (p<0.01) were nominally associated with DNP: polymorphisms in TF, TFRC, BMP6, ACO1, SLC11A2, and FXN conferred reduced risk (adjusted odds ratios [ORs] ranging from 0.2 to 0.7, all p<0.05); other variants in TF, CP, ACO1, BMP6, and B2M conferred increased risk (ORs ranging from 1.3 to 3.1, all p<0.05). Risks associated with some variants were statistically significant either in black or white subgroups but were consistent in direction. ACO1 rs2026739 remained significantly associated with DNP in whites (permutation p<0.0001) after correction for multiple tests. Several of the same iron-regulatory-gene polymorphisms, including ACO1 rs2026739, were also associated with severity of DNP (all p<0.05). Common polymorphisms in iron-management genes are associated with DNP and with DNP severity in HIV-infected persons receiving cART. Consistent risk estimates across population subgroups and persistence of the ACO1 rs2026739 association after adjustment for multiple testing suggest that genetic variation in iron-regulation and transport modulates susceptibility to DNP.

25156970,"Seasonal variations in developmental competence and relative abundance of gene transcripts in buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) oocytes.","Hot season is a major constraint to production and reproduction in buffaloes. The present work aimed to investigate the effect of season on ovarian function, developmental competence, and the relative abundance of gene expression in buffalo oocytes. Three experiments were conducted. In experiment 1, pairs of buffalo ovaries were collected during cold season (CS, autumn and winter) and hot season (HS, spring and summer), and the number of antral follicles was recorded. Cumulus oocyte complexes (COCs) were aspirated and evaluated according to their morphology into four Grades. In experiment 2, Grade A and B COCs collected during CS and HS were in vitro matured (IVM) for 24 hours under standard conditions at 38.5 °C in a humidified air of 5% CO2. After IVM, cumulus cells were removed and oocytes were fixed, stained with 1% aceto-orcein, and evaluated for nuclear configuration. In vitro matured buffalo oocytes harvested during CS or HS were in vitro fertilized (IVF) using frozen-thawed buffalo semen and cultured in vitro to the blastocyst stage. In experiment 3, buffalo COCs and in vitro matured oocytes were collected during CS and HS, and then snap frozen in liquid nitrogen for gene expression analysis. Total RNA was extracted from COCs and in vitro matured oocytes, and complementary DNA was synthesized; quantitative Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction was performed for eight candidate genes including GAPDH, ACTB, B2M, GDF9, BMP15, HSP70, and SOD2. The results indicated that HS significantly (P < 0.01) decreased the number of antral follicles and the number of COCs recovered per ovary. The number of Grade A, B, and C COCs was lower (P < 0.05) during HS than CS. In vitro maturation of buffalo oocytes during HS significantly (P < 0.01) reduced the number of oocytes reaching the metaphase II stage and increased the percentage of degenerated oocytes compared with CS. Oocytes collected during HS also showed signs of cytoplasmic degeneration. After IVF, cleavage rate was lower (P < 0.01) for oocytes collected during HS, and the percentage of oocytes arrested at the two-cell stage was higher (P < 0.01) than oocytes IVF during CS. Oocytes matured during CS showed a higher (P < 0.01) blastocyst rate than those matured during HS. Also, COCs recovered in HS showed significant (P < 0.05) upregulation of HSP70 mRNA expression compared with those recovered in CS. For in vitro matured oocytes, CS down regulated the transcript abundance of ACTB and upregulated GAPDH and HSP70 mRNA levels compared with HS condition. In conclusion, HS could impair buffalo fertility by reducing the number of antral follicles and oocyte quality. In vitro maturation of buffalo oocytes during HS impairs their nuclear and cytoplasmic maturation, fertilization, and subsequent embryo development to the morula and blastocyst stages. This could be in part because of the altered gene expression found in COCs and in vitro matured oocytes.","1879-3231","Theriogenology","(82) 1055-67",2014,"Ahmed S","Abdoon","AS","Department of Animal Reproduction and Artificial Insemination, Veterinary Research Division, National Research Center, Cairo, Egypt; Institute of Veterinary Biochemistry, Freie Universität Berlin, Berlin, Germany.

Previous studies have suggested that the prevalence of disease subgroups and cytogenetic profiles differ between Western and Asian patients. To characterize the coding genome of Chinese DLBCL, we performed whole-exome sequencing of DNA derived from 31 tumors and respective peripheral blood samples. The mutation prevalence of B2M, CD70, DTX1, LYN, TMSB4X, and UBE2A was investigated in an additional 105 tumor samples. We discovered 11 novel targets of recurrent mutations in DLBCL that included functionally relevant genes such as LYN and TMSB4X. Additional genes were found mutated at high frequency (≥10%) in the Chinese cohort including DTX1, which was the most prevalent mutation target in the Notch pathway. We furthermore demonstrated that mutations in DTX1 impair its function as a negative regulator of Notch. Novel and previous unappreciated targets of somatic mutations in DLBCL identified in this study support the existence of additional/alternative tumorigenic pathways in these tumors. The observed differences with previous reports might be explained by the genetic heterogeneity of DLBCL, the germline genetic makeup of Chinese individuals, and/or exposure to distinct etiological agents.

To identify the most suitable reference genes for RT-qPCR analysis of target gene expression in the hepatopancreas of crucian carp (Carassius auratus) under various conditions (sex, age, water temperature, and drug treatments), seven reference genes, including beta actin (ACTB), beta-2 microglobulin (B2M), embryonic elongation factor-1 alpha (EEF1A), glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), alpha tubulin (TUBA), ribosomal protein l8 (RPL8) and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH), were evaluated in this study. The stability and ranking of gene expression were analyzed using three different statistical programs: GeNorm, Normfinder and Bestkeeper. The expression errors associated with selection of the genes were assessed by the relative quantity of CYP4T. The results indicated that all the seven genes exhibited variability under the experimental conditions of this research, and the combination of ACTB/TUBA/EEF1A or of ACTB/EEF1A was the best candidate that raised the accuracy of quantitative analysis of gene expression.

We identified 9 publically available datasets that included gene expression data from saliva and salivary gland biopsy samples of 52 patients with SS and 51 controls. Out of these datasets, we compiled and pooled data from three datasets that included 37 and 29 samples from SS patients and healthy controls, respectively, which were designated as ""training set."" Then, we performed cross-listing in a group of independent gene expression datasets from patients with SS to identify consensus gene list of differentially expressed genes.

This technology is simple and sensitive; however the results may vary significantly due to the use of various reference genes (RGs) as normalizers. Therefore, the reliable use of RGs is vital for obtaining accurate results. The present study focuses on ten putative RGs for the normalization of qPCR data between human bone marrow-derived MSCs (BM-MSCs) and fetal tissue-derived MSCs (FT-MSCs). The total RNA from these two types of MSC was isolated using TRIzol reagent. cDNA was generated from the RNA via reverse transcription and subsequently analyzed by qPCR using ten common RGs as normalizers. These RGs included 18S, ACTB, B2M, HPRT1, GAPDH, TBP, PPIA, RPLP0, PGK1 and RPL13A. GeNorm, NormFinder and BestKeeper software were used to analyze the qPCR results by evaluating the expression stabilities of the ten candidate RGs in BM-MSCs and FT-MSCs. Consequently, several of the commonly used RGs, including 18S, ACTB and TBP, were demonstrated to be unsuitable for normalization in these two MSCs, whereas RPL13A, B2M and PPIA were the most stable RGs and were therefore reliable for use in qPCR studies. Combining multiple RGs had no contribution towards increasing their stabilities. In conclusion, the present study revealed that RPL13A, B2M and PPIA were the optimal RGs for qPCR studies comparing BM-MSCs and FT-MSCs.

To date, no validated reference genes have been identified for endometrial cancer tissues. In this study, 10 normalization genes (GAPDH, B2M, ACTB, POLR2A, UBC, PPIA, HPRT1, GUSB, TBP, H3F3A) belonging to different functional and abundance classes in various tissues and used in different studies, were analyzed to determine their applicability. In total, 100 endometrioid endometrial cancer samples, which were carefully balanced according to their tumor grade, and 29 normal endometrial tissues were examined using SYBR Green Real-Time RT-PCR. The expression stability of candidate reference genes was determined and compared by means of geNorm and NormFinder softwares. Both algorithms were in agreement in identifying GAPDH, H3F3A, PPIA, and HPRT1 as the most stably expressed genes, only differing in their ranking order. Analysis performed on the expression levels of all candidate genes confirm HPRT1 and PPIA as the most stably expressed in the study groups regardless of sample type, to be used alone or better in combination. As the stable expression of HPRT1 and PPIA between normal and tumor endometrial samples fulfill the basic requirement of a reference gene to be used for normalization purposes, HPRT1 expression showed significant differences between samples from low-grade and high-grade tumors. In conclusion, our results recommend the use of PPIA as a single reference gene to be considered for improved reliability of normalization in gene expression studies involving endometrial tumor samples at different tumor degrees.

Enforced wild-type B2M expression in a cHL cell line restored MHC-I expression. In an extended cohort of 145 patients, the absence of B2M protein in the HRS cells was associated with lower stage of disease, younger age at diagnosis, and better overall and progression-free survival. B2M-deficient cases encompassed most of the nodular sclerosis subtype cases and only a minority of mixed cellularity cases, suggesting that B2M deficiency determines the tumor microenvironment and may define a major subset of cHL that has more uniform clinical and morphologic features.

We examined predicted on- and off-target mutations via target capture sequencing in HSPCs and observed low levels of off-target mutagenesis at only one site. These results demonstrate that CRISPR/Cas9 can efficiently ablate genes in HSPCs with minimal off-target mutagenesis, which could have broad applicability for hematopoietic cell-based therapy.","1875-9777","Cell stem cell","(15) 643-52",2014,"Pankaj K","Mandal","PK","Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Biology, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA 02138, USA; Program in Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, MA 02116, USA."
25550045,"Selection of appropriate reference genes for RT-qPCR analysis in Berkshire, Duroc, Landrace, and Yorkshire pigs.","Reverse transcription quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) is the most reliable molecular biology technique for assessment of mRNA expression levels. However, to obtain the accurate RT-qPCR results, the expression levels of genes of interest should be normalized with appropriate reference genes and optimal numbers of reference genes. In this study, we assessed the expression stability of 15 well-known candidate reference genes (ACTB, ALDOA, B2M, GAPDH, HPAR1, HSPCB, PGK1, POLR2G, PPIA, RPL4, RPS18, SDHA, TBP, TOP2B, and YWHAZ) in seven body tissues (liver, lung, kidney, spleen, stomach, small intestine, and large intestine) of Berkshire, Landrace, Duroc, and Yorkshire pigs using three excel-based programs, geNorm, NormFinder, and BestKeeper. Combination analysis of these three programs showed that the stable and appropriate reference genes are PPIA, TBP, and HSPCB in Berkshire pigs; PPIA, TBP, RPL4, and RPS18 in Landrace pigs; PPIA and TBP in Duroc pigs; and PPIA, TOP2B, RPL4, and RPS18 in Yorkshire pigs. Because the four pig breeds had different suitable reference genes, the selection of appropriate reference genes is essential in RT-qPCR analyses. Taken together, our data could help to select reliable reference genes for the normalization of expression levels of various target genes in pigs.","1879-0038","Gene","(558) 152-8",2015,"Sang-Je","Park","SJ","National Primate Research Center, Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology, Chungbuk 363-883, Republic of Korea.

25573171,"Identification of suitable reference genes for gene expression studies using quantitative polymerase chain reaction in lung cancer in vitro.","The present study aimed to examine 10 housekeeping genes (HKGs), including 18s ribosomal RNA (18S), glyceraldehyde‑3‑phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), ribosomal protein large P0 (RPLP0), β‑actin (ACTB), peptidylprolyl isomerase A (PPIA), phosphoglycerate kinase‑1 (PGK1), β‑2‑microglobulin (B2M), ribosomal protein LI3a (RPL13A), hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl transferase‑1 (HPRT1) and TATA box binding protein (TBP) in order to identify the most stable and suitable reference genes for use in expression studies in non‑small cell lung cancer. The mRNA expression encoding the panel of the 10 HKGs was determined using reverse transcription‑quantitative PCR (RT‑qPCR) in human lung cancer cell lines. Three software programs, BestKeeper, NormFinder and geNorm, were used to ascertain the most suitable reference genes to normalize the RNA input. The present study examined three lung cancer cell lines (A549, NCI‑H446 and NCI‑H460). The analysis of the experimental data using BestKeeper software revealed that all 10 HKGs were stable, with GADPH, followed by 18S being the most stable genes and PPIA and HPRT1 being the least stable genes. The NormFinder software results demonstrated that PPIA followed by ACTB were the most stable and B2M and RPLP0 were the least stable. The geNorm software results revealed that ACTB and PGK1, followed by PPIA were the most stable genes and B2M and RPLP0 were identified as the least stable genes. Due to discrepancies in the ranking orders of the reference genes obtained by different analyzing software programs, it was not possible to determine a single universal reference gene. The suitability of selected reference genes requires unconditional validation prior to each study. Based on the three analyzing programs, ACTB, PPIA and PGK1 were the most stable reference genes in lung cancer cell lines.","1791-3004","Molecular medicine reports","(11) 3767-73",2015,"Hassan","Ali","H","Department of Central Laboratory, Second Hospital, Jilin University, Changchun, Jilin 130041, P.R.

25584151,"Variation of nephrotoxicity biomarkers by urinary storage condition in rats.","Recently, there has been an increase in the use of several nephrotoxicity biomarkers in preclinical experiments. In addition, it has been indicated that the result may have been influenced by secondary factors, such as sample storage condition or storage period. In this study, we have assessed the variation in urinary nephrotoxicity biomarkers as a result of urine storage conditions and storage period of the urine. Urine was sampled from specific pathogen-free Sprague-Dawley rats (19 weeks old), which were housed individually in hanged stainless steel wire mesh cages. Urine was stored at 20℃, at 4℃, or at -70℃ after sampling. The levels of the biomarkers such as beta-2 microglobulin (B2M), cystatin-C (Cys-C), N-acetyl-β- D-glucosaminidase (NAG), micro albumin (MA), micro protein (MP) were measured at 6, 24, 48 and 144 hr after sampling. The B2M level was significantly decreased at 6, 24, 48, and 144 hr compared to 0 hr at -70℃ (p < 0.05, p < 0.01, p < 0.05, and p < 0.05, respectively) and 24 and 144 hr at 20℃ (p < 0.01, p < 0.01, respectively). The Cys-C level was significantly decreased at 144 hr compared to 0 hr at 4℃ (p < 0.01), at 20℃ (p < 0.05) and at 70℃ (p < 0.01). MP and MA levels were not different for 144 hr in all storage conditions. Taken together, B2M and Cys-C levels were modulated by storage temperature and period. For the enhancement of test accuracy, it is suggested that strict protocols be established for samples to minimize the effects of the storage conditions on the detected levels of biomarkers.

The ATP-binding cassette is involved in drug metabolism, and the polymorphism of this gene may be an important risk factor in B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) or progression and/or response to chemotherapy agents. For the first time, the present study was aimed to evaluate the probable effects of ABCB1 T3435C polymorphism on clinical and laboratory features of Kurdish patients with B-CLL. This descriptive analytical case-control study was performed on 50 B-CLL patients and 100 healthy subjects. Serum levels of beta-2-microglobulin (B2M) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and blood WBC, RBC, Plt and ESR were measured. The T3435C polymorphism of the ABCB1 gene was determined by PCR-RFLP. Concentration of serum and blood markers was significantly higher in the malignant group than in the benign subjects. The CC genotype had the highest frequency (66%) in the patient groups. There are no significant differences between the genotypes and type of treatment. Our results demonstrate the high frequency of C allele of ABCB1 T3435C in B-CLL patients with Kurdish ethnicity. We also show that this polymorphism has a significant risk factor in B-CLL. However, the effect of this polymorphism on clinical and laboratory characteristics of B-CLL patients was not significant.","1423-0380","Tumour biology : the journal of the International Society for Oncodevelopmental Biology and Medicine","(36) 2863-8",2015,"Farzad","Maroofi","F","Department of Biochemistry, College of Science, Kurdistan Science and Research Branch, Islamic Azad University, Sanandaj, Iran."

Using large-scale genomic data sets of solid tissue tumor biopsies, we quantified the cytolytic activity of the local immune infiltrate and identified associated properties across 18 tumor types. The number of predicted MHC Class I-associated neoantigens was correlated with cytolytic activity and was lower than expected in colorectal and other tumors, suggesting immune-mediated elimination. We identified recurrently mutated genes that showed positive association with cytolytic activity, including beta-2-microglobulin (B2M), HLA-A, -B and -C and Caspase 8 (CASP8), highlighting loss of antigen presentation and blockade of extrinsic apoptosis as key strategies of resistance to cytolytic activity. Genetic amplifications were also associated with high cytolytic activity, including immunosuppressive factors such as PDL1/2 and ALOX12B/15B. Our genetic findings thus provide evidence for immunoediting in tumors and uncover mechanisms of tumor-intrinsic resistance to cytolytic activity.

The task was to identify skin samples/contact traces using specific RNA biomarkers and test three housekeeping genes for their suitability as reference genes. Eight stains, a skin RNA dilution series and, optionally, bona fide or mock casework samples of human or non-human origin were analyzed by 22 participating laboratories using RNA extraction or RNA/DNA co-extraction methods. Two sets of previously described skin-specific markers were used: skin1 pentaplex (LCE1C, LCE1D, LCE2D, IL1F7 and CCL27) and skin2 triplex (LOR, KRT9 and CDSN) in conjunction with a housekeeping gene, HKG, triplex (B2M, UBC and UCE). The laboratories used different chemistries and instrumentation. All laboratories were able to successfully isolate and detect mRNA in contact traces (e.g., human skin, palm-, hand- and fingerprints, clothing, car interiors, computer accessories and electronic devices). The simultaneous extraction of RNA and DNA provides an opportunity for positive identification of the tissue source of origin by mRNA profiling as well as a simultaneous identification of the body fluid donor by STR profiling. The skin markers LCE1C and LOR and the housekeeping gene marker B2M were detected in the majority of contact traces. Detection of the other markers was inconsistent, possibly due to the low amounts and/or poor quality of the genetic material present in shed skin cells. The results of this and the previous collaborative RNA exercises support RNA profiling as a reliable body fluid/tissue identification method that can easily be combined with current STR typing technology.","1878-0326","Forensic science international.

Conversely, its effect on cancer cells has been very little investigated. We studied the effect of high doses of gentamicin on non-Hodgkin's T-cell human lymphoblastic lymphoma (SUP-T1). We showed that gentamicin delayed cell growth and induced cell death in lymphoma cells with a rather mild effect on lymphocytes. In SUP-T1 cells, GAPDH, B2M, CDKN1A and CDKN1B were down-expressed in comparison with lymphocytes. Gentamicin treatment in SUP-T1 cells restored the expression of GAPDH, B2M and CDKN1A to values similar to those of lymphocytes and caused overexpression of CDKN1B. The drug acted via sphingomyelin metabolism; in whole cells, sphingomyelinase activity was stimulated, whereas in purified nuclei, sphingomyelinase activity was inhibited and that of sphingomyelin-synthase was stimulated, with a consequent high level of nuclear sphingomyelin content. We suggest that the increase of nuclear sphingomyelin might enrich the nucleus of lipid microdomains that act as a platform for active chromatin and, thus, might be responsible for gene expression. It is possible that in lymphoblastic lymphoma, high doses of gentamicin induce a beneficial therapeutic outcome.

We then correlated these inflammatory biomarker levels with urine protein/creatinine ratios (uPCR), urine albumin/creatinine ratios (uACR), and estimated glomerular filtration rates (eGFR). Urine inflammatory biomarker levels were highest in Group B. When combining all four study groups, statistically significant positive correlations included uPCR with urine IL-8, urine MCP-1, urine IP-10, and serum IP-10 and uACR with urine IL-8, urine B2M, serum IP-10, and serum B2M. eGFR was statistically significantly negatively correlated with serum MCP-1 and serum B2M. Paired serum and urine levels of IP-10 and B2M (but not IL-8, RANTES, or MCP-1) were significantly correlated with each other in the overall group. The levels of urine inflammatory markers tested differed by HIV status and use of virologically suppressive ART. These urine and serum inflammatory markers were differentially correlated with uPCR, uACR, and eGFR, suggesting that different intrarenal and systemic inflammatory pathways may contribute to different measures of nephropathy.","1931-8405","AIDS research and human retroviruses","(31) 375-83",2015,"Takashi","Shinha","T","1 Department of Medicine, Indiana University School of Medicine , Indianapolis, Indiana."
25653127,"Does deamidation cause protein unfolding? A top-down tandem mass spectrometry study.","Deamidation is a nonenzymatic post-translational modification of asparagine to aspartic acid or glutamine to glutamic acid, converting an uncharged amino acid to a negatively charged residue. It is plausible that deamidation of asparagine and glutamine residues would result in disruption of a proteins' hydrogen bonding network and thus lead to protein unfolding. To test this hypothesis Calmodulin and B2M were deamidated and analyzed using tandem mass spectrometry on a Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometer (FTICR-MS). The gas phase hydrogen bonding networks of deamidated and nondeamidated protein isoforms were probed by varying the infra-red multi-photon dissociation laser power in a linear fashion and plotting the resulting electron capture dissociation fragment intensities as a melting curve at each amino acid residue. Analysis of the unfolding maps highlighted increased fragmentation at lower laser powers localized around heavily deamidated regions of the proteins. In addition fragment intensities were decreased across the rest of the proteins which we propose is because of the formation of salt-bridges strengthening the intramolecular interactions of the central regions. These results were supported by a computational flexibility analysis of the mutant and unmodified proteins, which would suggest that deamidation can affect the global structure of a protein via modification of the hydrogen bonding network near the deamidation site and that top down FTICR-MS is an appropriate technique for studying protein folding.

In this study, five candidate reference genes (B2M, RPL32, SDHA, TBP and YWHAZ) were evaluated to determine the most stable internal reference for quantitative PCR normalization in the two main commercial muscles (pectoralis major (breast) and biceps femoris (thigh)), liver and abdominal fat. Four statistical methods (geNorm, NormFinder, CV and BestKeeper) were used in the evaluation of the most suitable combination of reference genes. Additionally, a comprehensive ranking was established with the RefFinder tool. This analysis identified YWHAZ and TBP as the recommended combination for the analysis of biceps femoris and liver, YWHAZ and RPL32 for pectoralis major and RPL32 and B2M for abdominal fat and across-tissue studies. The final ranking for each tool changed slightly but overall the results, and most particularly the ability to discard the least robust candidates, were consistent between tools. The selection and number of reference genes were validated using SCD, a target gene related to fat metabolism.

Between November 2005 and July 2014, a total of 52 patients with MCL were identified from the database of Asan Medical Center, Seoul, Korea. Pretreatment serum B2M information was available in 50 patients (96%). Overall survival (OS) was compared according to the serum B2M level with a cut-off value of 2.5 mg/L. The median MCL international prognostic index (MIPI) score was 5.84 (range 4.72-7.80), and the median biologic MIPI (MIPI-b) score was 6.27 (4.93-8.47). Pretreatment serum B2M was elevated in 30 patients (60%) and was significantly related to advanced stage (p = 0.02) and high MIPI (p = 0.03) and MIPI-b (p = 0.03) scores. With median follow-up duration of 29.8 months (range 0.8-87.0 months), the median OS was 56.2 months [95% confidence interval (CI) 36.6-75.9 months] in all patients, and serum B2M was significantly associated with OS (p = 0.001). In multivariate analyses adjusted for MIPI or MIPI-b scores and rituximab, elevated serum B2M was significantly associated with poor OS (when adjusting MIPI, hazard ratio = 26.4, 95% CI 2.9-241.3, p = 0.004; when adjusting MIPI-b, hazard ratio = 20.1, 95% CI 2.4-170.1, p = 0.006).

Gene expression analysis may be a useful tool for understanding tendon tears and the failure of cuff healing, and reverse-transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) has become an effective method for such studies. However, this technique requires the use of suitable reference genes for data normalization. Here, we evaluate the suitability of six reference genes (18S, ACTB, B2M, GAPDH, HPRT1 and TBP) using samples from the rotator cuff tendons of 28 individuals with tendon tears (3 tendons regions) and 8 controls (2 tendon regions); for the tear patients, we evaluated ruptured and non-ruptured tendon samples. The stability of the candidate reference genes was determined using the NormFinder, geNorm, BestKeeper and DataAssist software packages. Overall, HPRT1 was the best single reference gene, and HPRT1+TBP composed the best pair and HPRT1+TBP+ACTB composed the best trio of reference genes from the analysis of different groups, including the simultaneous analysis of all tissue samples. To identify the optimal combination of reference genes, we evaluated the expression of COL1A1 and COL3A1, and no obvious differences were observed when using 2, 3 or 4 reference genes for most of the analyses. However, COL3A1 expression differed between ruptured and non-ruptured (posterior superior region) tendons of patients only when normalized by HPRT1+TBP+B2M and HPRT1+TBP. On the other hand, the comparison between these two groups using the best trio of reference genes (HPRT1+TBP+ACTB) and 4 reference genes did not revealed a significant difference in COL3A1 expression. Consequently, the use of suitable reference genes for a reliable gene expression evaluation by RT-qPCR should consider the type of tendon samples investigated. HPRT1+TBP+ACTB seems to be the best combination of reference genes for the analysis of involving different tendon samples of individuals with rotator cuff tears.

We present a straightforward strategy to decrease the presence of MHC-I by shRNA inhibition of beta-2-microglobulin (B2M), a conservative light chain of MHC-I, on the surface of two main cell types that are used to engineer heart tissue constructs. Engineered heart tissue constructs can be generated by combining mouse WT19 fibroblasts and mouse embryonic stem cell-derived cardiac myocytes (mESC-CM). WT19 fibroblasts were stably transduced with an anti-B2M shRNA, which yielded a cell line with dramatically reduced B2M expression levels (16 ± 11% of mock treated control cell line). Interferon gamma treatment increased the levels of B2M expression by >3-fold in both control and transduced fibroblasts; yet, B2M expression levels still remained very low in the transduced cells. When compared with their unmodified counterparts, transduced fibroblasts caused 5.7-fold lesser activation of cognate T-cells. B2M depletion in mESC-CM was achieved by 72 h transduction with anti-B2M shRNA lentiviral particles. Transduced mESC-CM exhibited regular beating and expressed classical cardiac markers. When compared with their unmodified counterparts, transduced mESC-CM caused 2.5-fold lesser activation of cognate T-cells. In vivo assessment of B2M downregulation was performed by analyzing the preferential survival of B2M-downregulated cells in the intraperitoneal cavity of allogeneic mice. Both B2M-downregulated fibroblasts and B2M-downregulated myocytes survived significantly better when compared to their unmodified counterparts (2.01 ± 0.4 and 5.07 ± 1.6 fold increase in survival, respectively). In contrast, when modified WT19 fibroblasts were injected into the intraperitoneal cavity of syngeneic C57Bl/6 mice, no significant survival advantage was observed. Notably, the preferential survival of B2M-downregulated cells persisted in allogeneic hosts with normal levels of natural killer cells, although the effect was lesser in magnitude. Use of shRNA against beta-2-microglobulin offers a simple and effective approach to minimize immunogenicity of the main cellular components of cardiac tissue constructs in non-syngeneic recipients.","1748-605X","Biomedical materials (Bristol, England)","(10) 034101",2015,"Zaruhi","Karabekian","Z","Pharmacology and Physiology Department, The George Washington University, School of Medicine and Health Sciences, 2300 Eye Street, Washington DC 20037, USA."

In most cases, however, commonly used reference genes are employed in data normalization without proper validation, which may lead to incorrect data interpretation. Here, we aim to select a set of optimal reference genes for the accurate normalization of gene expression associated with intramuscular fat (IMF) deposition during development. In the present study, eight reference genes (PPIB, HMBS, RPLP0, B2M, YWHAZ, 18S, GAPDH and ACTB) were evaluated by three different algorithms (geNorm, NormFinder and BestKeeper) in two types of muscle tissues (longissimus dorsi muscle and biceps femoris muscle) across different developmental stages. All three algorithms gave similar results. PPIB and HMBS were identified as the most stable reference genes, while the commonly used reference genes 18S and GAPDH were the most variably expressed, with expression varying dramatically across different developmental stages. Furthermore, to reveal the crucial role of appropriate reference genes in obtaining a reliable result, analysis of PPARG expression was performed by normalization to the most and the least stable reference genes. The relative expression levels of PPARG normalized to the most stable reference genes greatly differed from those normalized to the least stable one. Therefore, evaluation of reference genes must be performed for a given experimental condition before the reference genes are used. PPIB and HMBS are the optimal reference genes for analysis of gene expression associated with IMF deposition in skeletal muscle during development.

25894839,"Simulation-extrapolation method to address errors in atomic bomb survivor dosimetry on solid cancer and leukaemia mortality risk estimates, 1950-2003.","Analyses of the Life Span Study (LSS) of Japanese atomic bombing survivors have routinely incorporated corrections for additive classical measurement errors using regression calibration. Recently, several studies reported that the efficiency of the simulation-extrapolation method (SIMEX) is slightly more accurate than the simple regression calibration method (RCAL). In the present paper, the SIMEX and RCAL methods have been used to address errors in atomic bomb survivor dosimetry on solid cancer and leukaemia mortality risk estimates. For instance, it is shown that using the SIMEX method, the ERR/Gy is increased by an amount of about 29 % for all solid cancer deaths using a linear model compared to the RCAL method, and the corrected EAR 10(-4) person-years at 1 Gy (the linear terms) is decreased by about 8 %, while the corrected quadratic term (EAR 10(-4) person-years/Gy(2)) is increased by about 65 % for leukaemia deaths based on a linear-quadratic model. The results with SIMEX method are slightly higher than published values. The observed differences were probably due to the fact that with the RCAL method the dosimetric data were partially corrected, while all doses were considered with the SIMEX method. Therefore, one should be careful when comparing the estimated risks and it may be useful to use several correction techniques in order to obtain a range of corrected estimates, rather than to rely on a single technique. This work will enable to improve the risk estimates derived from LSS data, and help to make more reliable the development of radiation protection standards.

Quantitative PCR (qPCR) is a method of choice for gene expression analysis but the usage of reliable reference genes for the normalization process is critical. Commonly used reference genes may vary in expression level between different experimental conditions providing wrong quantitative results of the studied genes' expression levels. Fourteen potential endogenous control genes were analyzed by qPCR method in NK-92 cell line that shows characteristics of human natural killer cells and is often used in studies on biology of NK lymphocytes.

In gene expression analysis of the differentiation of BMSCs into neuronal cells by, the commonly used reference genes for RNA analysis are often selected without any preliminary evaluation of their suitability. The present study aimed to evaluate the mRNA expression levels of 11 putative reference genes, including ACTB, ARBP, B2M, CYCA, GAPDH, GUSB, HPRT, PPIA, RPL13A, TBP and PGK1, in order to select the most suitable reference genes for RT-qPCR of the differentiation of neuronal cells by BMSCs.

Tissue engineering in BMSCs has made great advances in the regeneration of cartilage and bone defects. To uncover the mechanisms of the multipotent differentiation process, the molecular changes in gene expression profiles during chondrogenic and osteogenic differentiation need to be evaluated with reliable, accurate, fast and sensitive methods. Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction is a commonly used technology for analyzing gene expression, depending on an appropriate reference gene to normalize the errors. The commonly used reference genes vary, and no ideal and universal reference genes suitable for all conditions exist; therefore validation of the stability of gene expression is required. In the present study, three common statistical algorithms, geNorm, Normfinder and BestKeeper, were used to identify the expression stability of 12 genes, and the target differentiation markers during the differentiation of BMSCs were evaluated accurately. Our results demonstrated that YWHAZ, PPIA and GAPDH were suitable as reference genes for chondrogenic differentiation, while RPL13a allowed an efficient normalization expression value of interest genes for osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs. By contrast, the most unstable reference genes were 18s rRNA, B2M and HPRT1 in all studies, and these should be avoided when investigating the differentiation of BMSCs.

The selection of reliable RGs therefore has an important impact on the experimental outcome. In this study, we aimed to identify and validate the best suited RGs for qRT-PCR in human primary keratinocytes (KCs) over a broad range of experimental conditions using the novel bioinformatics tool 'RefGenes', which is based on a manually curated database of published microarray data. Expression of 6 RGs identified by RefGenes software and 12 commonly used RGs were validated by qRT-PCR. We assessed whether these 18 markers fulfilled the requirements for a valid RG by the comprehensive ranking of four bioinformatics tools and the coefficient of variation (CV). In an overall ranking, we found GUSB to be the most stably expressed RG, whereas the expression values of the commonly used RGs, GAPDH and B2M were significantly affected by varying experimental conditions.

Exploring the hypothesis that youthful calibration of key signaling pathways may enhance regeneration of multiple old tissues, we found that systemically attenuating TGF-β signaling with a single drug simultaneously enhanced neurogenesis and muscle regeneration in the same old mice, findings further substantiated via genetic perturbations. At the levels of cellular mechanism, our results establish that the age-specific increase in TGF-β1 in the stem cell niches of aged hippocampus involves microglia and that such an increase is pro-inflammatory both in brain and muscle, as assayed by the elevated expression of β2 microglobulin (B2M), a component of MHC class I molecules. These findings suggest that at high levels typical of aged tissues, TGF-β1 promotes inflammation instead of its canonical role in attenuating immune responses. In agreement with this conclusion, inhibition of TGF-β1 signaling normalized B2M to young levels in both studied tissues.

An important contributor might be a decline in the cardioprotective effects of high-density lipoprotein (HDL). One important factor affecting HDL's cardioprotective properties may involve the alterations of protein composition in HDL. In the current study, we used complementary proteomics approaches to detect and quantify relative levels of proteins in HDL isolated from control and ESRD subjects. Shotgun proteomics analysis of HDL isolated from 20 control and 40 ESRD subjects identified 63 proteins in HDL. Targeted quantitative proteomics by isotope-dilution selective reaction monitoring revealed that 22 proteins were significantly enriched and 6 proteins were significantly decreased in ESRD patients. Strikingly, six proteins implicated in renal disease, including B2M, CST3, and PTGDS, were markedly increased in HDL of uremic subjects. Moreover, several of these proteins (SAA1, apoC-III, PON1, etc.) have been associated with atherosclerosis. Our observations indicate that the HDL proteome is extensively remodeled in uremic subjects. Alterations of the protein cargo of HDL might impact HDL's proposed cardioprotective properties. Quantifying proteins in HDL may be useful in the assessment of cardiovascular risk in patients with ESRD and in assessing response to therapeutic interventions.

Mast cells play an important role in inflammation and angiogenesis in malignant diseases. The aim of the study was to evaluate the mast cell density in bone marrow of untreated MM patients with markers of disease activity such as serum interleukin-6 (IL-6), B2M, and C-reactive protein (CRP), the grade of bone marrow infiltration, and the levels of produced paraprotein. We studied 86 newly diagnosed MM patients (46 males, 40 females, mean age 59 ± 13.7 years). Thirty of them reached plateau phase after chemotherapy and 20 healthy volunteers. According to the criteria of International Staging System (ISS) staging system, 23 patients had stage I, 30 had stage II, and 33 had stage III. The serum concentrations of CRP, B2M, and IL-6, and the mast cell density (MCD) values were significantly higher in MM patients' group (1.6 ± 1.8, 4.3 ± 2.9, 7.1 ± 5.1, and 9 ± 4.8), in comparison with those found in control group (0.4 ± 0.1, 1.5 ± 0.6, 1.1 ± 0.5, and 1.9 ± 0.7; p < 0.001 in all the cases). Significant differences were found between the grade of infiltration in bone marrow, and the paraprotein values in patients' serum before and after chemotherapy. Furthermore, there was a significant correlation between the MCD values and the prognostic markers CRP (r = 0.452, p < 0.0001), IL-6 (r = 0.475, p < 0.0001), bone marrow infiltration (r = 0.333, p < 0.0002), and serum paraprotein levels(r = 0.221, p < 0.04).

The top-ranking reference genes determined by geNorm, when samples before and after therapy were analyzed (ACTB, B2M and GAPDH) were different from those (POLR2A and B2M) when only samples before treatment were analyzed. Using only a single reference gene for normalization of 7 target gene expression compared to our strategy, there would be as low as 19% of consistency in conclusions. We suggest the use of the geometric mean of ACTB, B2M and GAPDH for normalization of qPCR data of target genes in pharmacogenomics studies in asthma patients before and after anti-asthmatic therapy, however if gene expression is measured only before anti-asthmatic treatment, we recommend the use of the geometric mean of POLR2A and B2M.

Hsp90 levels proved to be a superior method for the earlier detection of ALL engraftment and correlated linearly to ALL burden and progression in all compartments, even at minimal residual disease levels. Importantly, the Hsp90/hCD45+ ratio was not altered when animals were treated with dexamethasone or a PI3K inhibitor, indicating that chemotherapy does not directly interfere with leukemia production of Hsp90. In conclusion, plasma Hsp90 was validated as a soluble biomarker of ALL, useful for earlier detection of leukemia engraftment, monitoring leukemia kinetics at residual disease levels, and pre-clinical or mouse avatar evaluations of anti-leukemic drugs.

Although known to influence gene expression, impact of age on housekeeping gene expression has not been determined after acute brain lesions such as traumatic brain injury (TBI). Therefore, expression of eight common control genes was investigated at 15 min, 24 h, and 72 h after experimental TBI in 2- and 21-month-old C57Bl6 mice. Expression of β2-microglobulin (B2M), β-actin (ActB), and porphobilinogen deaminase (PBGD) increased after TBI in both ages. β2M demonstrated age-dependent differences and highest inter- and intragroup variations. Expression of cyclophilin A, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), hypoxanthine ribosyltransferase (HPRT), S100B, and 18SrRNA remained stable. Cyclophilin A and HPRT demonstrated strongest inter- and intragroup stability. The data indicate that the expression of most but not all control genes is stable during aging. The correct choice of housekeeping genes is of key importance to ensure adequate normalization of qPCR data. With respect to insult and age, normalization strategies should consider cyclophilin A as a single normalizer. Normalization with two reference genes is recommended with cyclophilin A and HPRT in young mice and in mixed age studies and with cyclophilin A and GAPDH in old mice. In addition, the present study suggests not to use β2-microglobulin, β-actin or PBGD as single control genes because of strong regulation after CCI in 2- and 21-month-old mice.","1557-9042","Journal of neurotrauma","(32) 1777-88",2015,"Ralph","Timaru-Kast","R","Department of Anesthesiology, Medical Center of Johannes Gutenberg-University , Mainz, Germany ."

Experiments using heterochronic parabiosis, in which the circulatory systems of young and old animals are joined, indicate that circulating pro-aging factors in old blood drive aging phenotypes in the brain. Here we identify β2-microglobulin (B2M), a component of major histocompatibility complex class 1 (MHC I) molecules, as a circulating factor that negatively regulates cognitive and regenerative function in the adult hippocampus in an age-dependent manner. B2M is elevated in the blood of aging humans and mice, and it is increased within the hippocampus of aged mice and young heterochronic parabionts. Exogenous B2M injected systemically, or locally in the hippocampus, impairs hippocampal-dependent cognitive function and neurogenesis in young mice. The negative effects of B2M and heterochronic parabiosis are, in part, mitigated in the hippocampus of young transporter associated with antigen processing 1 (Tap1)-deficient mice with reduced cell surface expression of MHC I. The absence of endogenous B2M expression abrogates age-related cognitive decline and enhances neurogenesis in aged mice. Our data indicate that systemic B2M accumulation in aging blood promotes age-related cognitive dysfunction and impairs neurogenesis, in part via MHC I, suggesting that B2M may be targeted therapeutically in old age.

Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) has emerged as an effective method for such studies. However, this technique requires the use of suitable reference genes for data normalization. Here, we evaluated the suitability of six reference genes (18S, ACTB, B2M, GAPDH, HPRT1, and TBP) by using ACL samples of 39 individuals with ACL tears (20 with isolated ACL tears and 19 with ACL tear and combined meniscal injury) and of 13 controls. The stability of the candidate reference genes was determined by using the NormFinder, geNorm, BestKeeper DataAssist, and RefFinder software packages and the comparative ΔCt method. ACTB was the best single reference gene and ACTB+TBP was the best gene pair. The GenEx software showed that the accumulated standard deviation is reduced when a larger number of reference genes is used for gene expression normalization. However, the use of a single reference gene may not be suitable. To identify the optimal combination of reference genes, we evaluated the expression of FN1 and PLOD1. We observed that at least 3 reference genes should be used. ACTB+HPRT1+18S is the best trio for the analyses involving isolated ACL tears and controls. Conversely, ACTB+TBP+18S is the best trio for the analyses involving (1) injured ACL tears and controls, and (2) ACL tears of patients with meniscal tears and controls. Therefore, if the gene expression study aims to compare non-injured ACL, isolated ACL tears and ACL tears from patients with meniscal tear as three independent groups ACTB+TBP+18S+HPRT1 should be used.

Selection of optimal housekeeping genes (HKGs) as reference genes is critical to establishing sensitive and reproducible qRT-PCR-based assays. The current study was designed to identify the appropriate reference genes in blood leukocytes of bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) for gene transcription research. Seventy-five blood samples collected from 7 bottlenose dolphins were used to analyze 15 candidate HKGs (ACTB, B2M, GAPDH, HPRT1, LDHB, PGK1, RPL4, RPL8, RPL18, RPS9, RPS18, TFRC, YWHAZ, LDHA, SDHA). HKG stability in qRT-PCR was determined using geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper and comparative delta Ct algorithms. Utilization of RefFinder, which combined all 4 algorithms, suggested that PGK1, HPRT1 and RPL4 were the most stable HKGs in bottlenose dolphin blood. Gene transcription perturbations in blood can serve as an indication of health status in cetaceans as it occurs prior to alterations in hematology and chemistry. This study identified HKGs that could be used in gene transcript studies, which may contribute to further mRNA relative quantification research in the peripheral blood leukocytes in captive cetaceans.

Though outcomes have improved by optimizing conventional therapies, recent immunotherapeutic successes in adult cancers are emerging. Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) are the primary executioners of adaptive antitumor immunity and require antigenic presentation in the context of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and the associated β-2-microglobulin (B2M). Loss of MHC I expression is a common immune escape mechanism in adult malignancies, but pediatric cancers have not been thoroughly characterized.

An experiment was conducted to investigate the mechanisms under pinning the reduced serum IgG concentration at 24 h postpartum in the progeny of iodine supplemented dams. Forty-five mature twin bearing ewes (n=15/treatment) were allocated to one of three dietary treatments as follows: basal diet (Control); basal diet plus 26.6 mg of iodine per ewe per day as calcium iodate (CaIO3); or potassium iodide (KI). Ewes were individually housed and fed from d 119 of gestation until parturition. All lambs received colostrum at 1, 10 and 18 h postpartum via stomach tube. At 1 h postpartum lambs from the control and an iodine supplemented treatment (n=10 per treatment from control and CaIO3) were euthanised before colostrum consumption and ileal segments isolated to determine the gene expression profile of a panel of genes identified as having a role in antibody transfer. Preceding euthanasia, lambs were blood sampled for determination of serum IgG, total thyroxine and free tri-iodothyronine concentrations. Progeny of CaIO3 supplemented dams had lower tri-iodothyronine concentrations (P<0.01) at 1 h postpartum and lower serum IgG concentrations (P<0.001) at 24 h postpartum when compared with the progeny of control dams. Iodine (CaIO3) supplementation of the dam increased the relative expression (P<0.05) of the B2M, PIGR and MYC genes in the ileum of the lamb, before colostrum consumption; while the expression of THRB declined when compared with the progeny of C dams (P<0.01). In conclusion, the results of this study show that it is the actual inclusion of excess iodine in the diet of the ewe, regardless of the carrier element, that negatively affects passive transfer in the newborn lamb. This study presents novel data describing the relationship between maternal iodine nutrition and its effect on the thyroid hormone status and subsequent gene expression in the newborn lamb; which results in a failure of passive transfer and a decline in serum IgG concentration.

It often correlates with poor prognosis and resistance to therapy. However, current knowledge about the frequency, underlying molecular mechanisms, and prognostic value of HLA class I and II alterations in prostate cancer (PC) is limited. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated that 88 % of the 42 studied cryopreserved prostate tumors have at least one type of HLA alteration as compared to adjacent normal prostate epithelium or benign hyperplasia. Total loss of HLA-I expression found in 50 % of tumors showed an association with increased incidence of tumor relapse, perineural invasion, and high D'Amico risk. The remaining HLA-I-positive tumors demonstrated locus and allelic losses detected in 26 and 12 % of samples, respectively. Loss of heterozygosity at chromosome 6 was detected in 32 % of the studied tumors. Molecular analysis revealed a reduced expression of B2M, TAP2, tapasin and NLRC5 mRNA in microdissected HLA-I-negative tumors. Analysis of twelve previously unreported cell lines derived from neoplastic and normal epithelium of cancerous prostate revealed different types of HLA-I aberration, ranging from locus and/or allelic downregulation to a total absence of HLA-I expression. The high incidence of HLA-I loss observed in PC, caused by both regulatory and structural defects, is associated with more aggressive disease development and may pose a real threat to patient health by increasing cancer progression and resistance to T-cell-based immunotherapy.

26625115,"Can Genetic Analysis of Putative Blood Alzheimer's Disease Biomarkers Lead to Identification of Susceptibility Loci?","Although 24 Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk loci have been reliably identified, a large portion of the predicted heritability for AD remains unexplained. It is expected that additional loci of small effect will be identified with an increased sample size. However, the cost of a significant increase in Case-Control sample size is prohibitive. The current study tests whether exploring the genetic basis of endophenotypes, in this case based on putative blood biomarkers for AD, can accelerate the identification of susceptibility loci using modest sample sizes. Each endophenotype was used as the outcome variable in an independent GWAS. Endophenotypes were based on circulating concentrations of proteins that contributed significantly to a published blood-based predictive algorithm for AD. Endophenotypes included Monocyte Chemoattractant Protein 1 (MCP1), Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule 1 (VCAM1), Pancreatic Polypeptide (PP), Beta2 Microglobulin (B2M), Factor VII (F7), Adiponectin (ADN) and Tenascin C (TN-C). Across the seven endophenotypes, 47 SNPs were associated with outcome with a p-value ≤1x10(-7). Each signal was further characterized with respect to known genetic loci associated with AD. Signals for several endophenotypes were observed in the vicinity of CR1, MS4A6A/MS4A4E, PICALM, CLU, and PTK2B. The strongest signal was observed in association with Factor VII levels and was located within the F7 gene. Additional signals were observed in MAP3K13, ZNF320, ATP9B and TREM1. Conditional regression analyses suggested that the SNPs contributed to variation in protein concentration independent of AD status. The identification of two putatively novel AD loci (in the Factor VII and ATP9B genes), which have not been located in previous studies despite massive sample sizes, highlights the benefits of an endophenotypic approach for resolving the genetic basis for complex diseases. The coincidence of several of the endophenotypic signals with known AD loci may point to novel genetic interactions and should be further investigated.","1932-6203","PloS one","(10) e0142360",2015,"Robert C","Barber","RC","Department of Molecular & Medical Genetics, University of North Texas Health Science Center, Fort Worth, Texas, United States of America."

We applied 2 dimensional gel electrophoresis to compare seven GC B cell non Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) cell lines with a lymphoblastoid cell line (LCL). An average of 130 spots were at least two folds different in intensity between NHL cell lines and the LCL. We selected approximately 38 protein spots per NHL cell line and linked them to 145 unique spots based on the location in the gel. 34 spots that were found altered in at least three NHL cell lines when compared to LCL, were submitted for LC-MS/MS. This resulted in 28 unique proteins, a substantial proportion of these proteins were involved in cell motility and cell metabolism. Loss of expression of B2M, and gain of expression of PRDX1 and PPIA was confirmed in the cell lines and primary lymphoma tissue. Moreover, inhibition of PPIA with cyclosporine A blocked cell growth of the cell lines, the effect size was associated with the PPIA expression levels.

Although qPCR is a very efficient and sensitive tool, variations in the enzymatic efficiency, quality of RNA and the presence of inhibitors can lead to errors. Therefore, qPCR needs to be normalised to obtain reliable results and allow comparison. The most common approach is to use reference genes as internal controls in qPCR analyses. In this study, expression of seven genes, including β-actin (ACTB), β-2-microglobulin (B2M), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), β-glucuronidase (GUSB), TATA box binding protein (TBP), α-tubulin (TUBAT) and 28S ribosomal RNA (r28S), was determined in cells isolated from chicken lymphoid tissues and stimulated with three different mitogens. The stability of the genes was measured using geNorm, NormFinder and BestKeeper software. The results from both geNorm and NormFinder were that the three most stably expressed genes in this panel were TBP, GAPDH and r28S. BestKeeper did not generate clear answers because of the highly heterogeneous sample set. Based on these data we will include TBP in future qPCR normalisation.

27232341,"Normalization of qPCR in platelets - YWHAE a potential genericreference gene.","The mRNA of human platelets has been extensively studied and it is generally appreciated that platelets contain mRNA transcripts derived from the megakaryocytes, and they have the ability to translate it into proteins. Additionally, platelets contain microRNA (miRNA) that has been shown to potentially regulate the translation of certain proteins. When quantifying gene expression by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), a valid normalization method is required and the use of reference genes is a common and robust approach. It is recommended to perform a proper validation of potential reference genes for each individual experimental setup. Previous studies have mainly been performed using commonly used reference genes for nucleated cells, and to our knowledge there are no global evaluations of the stability of transcripts in platelets. Finding a stable transcript would be valuable for inter-study comparisons, and the aim of this study was to identify one or more stable mRNA transcripts suitable as generic reference genes for mRNA gene expression studies in platelets. Platelets were incubated for 24 h and microarray of platelet mRNA revealed that the levels of YWHAE, B2M, ITM2B, H3F3A, PF4V1 remained similar between 0 and 24 h. Further validation of the stability of these genes together with GAPDH, RN18S1, and PPIA, genes frequently used as reference genes in platelet studies, was performed using qPCR after different in vitro conditions. In addition, inter-individual stability of the genes was analyzed in diabetic patients compared with healthy matched controls. Analysis of gene stability by the software RefFinder revealed that YWHAE, PF4V1, and B2M were the most stable genes in platelets from healthy donors. In addition, YWHAE was stable between subjects. Furthermore, the potential influence of miRNA on the selected genes was investigated by knockdown of Dicer1 in the megakaryocytic cell line MEG01. YWHAE, H3F3A, B2M, and GAPDH remained unchanged over time in MEG01 cells indicating that these genes are not regulated by miRNA and hence are more stably expressed. In conclusion, YWHAE is a stable transcript in platelets and we suggest the use of YWHAE as a generic reference gene in mRNA gene expression studies.","1369-1635","Platelets","(27) 729-734",2016,"Karin","Mossberg","K","a Wallenberg Laboratory for Cardiovascular Research, Institute of Medicine, University of Gothenburg , Gothenburg , Sweden."
27261508,"Melanoma Lesions Independently Acquire T-cell Resistance during Metastatic Latency.","Melanoma often recurs after a latency period of several years, presenting a T cell-edited phenotype that reflects a role for CD8(+) T cells in maintaining metastatic latency. Here, we report an investigation of a patient with multiple recurrent lesions, where poorly immunogenic melanoma phenotypes were found to evolve in the presence of autologous tumor antigen-specific CD8(+) T cells. Melanoma cells from two of three late recurrent metastases, developing within a 6-year latency period, lacked HLA class I expression. CD8(+) T cell-resistant, HLA class I-negative tumor cells became clinically apparent 1.5 and 6 years into stage IV disease. Genome profiling by SNP arrays revealed that HLA class I loss in both metastases originated from a shared chromosome 15q alteration and independently acquired focal B2M gene deletions. A third HLA class I haplotype-deficient lesion developed in year 3 of stage IV disease that acquired resistance toward dominant CD8(+) T-cell clonotypes targeting stage III tumor cells. At an early stage, melanoma cells showed a dedifferentiated c-Jun(high)/MITF(low) phenotype, possibly associated with immunosuppression, which contrasted with a c-Jun(low)/MITF(high) phenotype of T cell-edited tumor cells derived from late metastases. In summary, our work shows how tumor recurrences after long-term latency evolve toward T-cell resistance by independent genetic events, as a means for immune escape and immunotherapeutic resistance.

Prognosis is particularly poor for relapses occurring less than one year after the end of first-line treatment (early relapses/ER) compared to those occurring more than one year after (late relapses/LR). To better understand genomic alterations underlying the delay of relapse, we identified copy number variations (CNVs) on 39 tumor samples from a homogeneous series of patients included in the Collaborative Trial in Relapsed Aggressive Lymphoma (CORAL) prospective study. To identify CNVs associated with ER or LR, we devised an original method based on Significance Analysis of Microarrays, a permutation-based method which allows control of false positives due to multiple testing. Deletions of CDKN2A/B (28%) and IBTK (23%) were frequent events in relapsed DLBCLs. We identified 56 protein-coding genes and 25 long non-coding RNAs with significantly differential CNVs distribution between ER and LR DLBCLs, with a false discovery rate < 0.05. In ER DLBCLs, CNVs were related to transcription regulation, cell cycle and apoptosis, with duplications of histone H1T (31%), deletions of DIABLO (26%), PTMS (21%) and CK2B (15%). In LR DLBCLs, CNVs were related to immune response, with deletions of B2M (20%) and CD58 (10%), cell proliferation regulation, with duplications of HES1 (25%) and DVL3 (20%), and transcription regulation, with MTERF4 deletions (20%). This study provides new insights into the genetic aberrations in relapsed DLBCLs and suggest pathway-targeted therapies in ER and LR DLBCLs.","1949-2553","Oncotarget","(7) 83987-84002",2016,"Julien","Broséus","J","Inserm U954, Faculty of Medicine, Nancy, France."

BMSCs were isolated from 20 ANFH patients divided into four groups according to etiology, and four donors with femoral neck fractures. Total RNA was isolated from BMSCs and reverse transcribed into complementary DNA, which served as a template for RT-qPCR. Three commonly used programs were then used to analyze the results. Reference gene expression varied within each group, between specific groups, and among all five groups. Based on comparisons of all five groups, two of the programs used suggested that HPRT1 was the most stable reference gene, while 18S and ACTB were the most variable. Among the 12 candidate reference genes, HPRT1 exhibited the greatest reliability, followed by PPIA. Thus, these sequences could be used as references for the normalization of RT-qPCR results.

Canine pyometra is a common clinical disease in bitches. When using RT-qPCR, internal standards, such as reference genes, are necessary to investigate relative gene expression by quantitative measurements of mRNA levels. The aim of this study was to evaluate the stability of reference genes and select reference genes suitable for canine pyometra studies. We collected 24 bitch uterine tissue samples, including five healthy and 19 pyometra infected samples. These were used to screen the best reference genes of seven candidate genes (18SrRNA, ACTB, B2M, GAPDH, HPRT, RPL13A, and YWHAZ). The method of KH Sadek and the GeNorm, Normfinder, BestKeeper, and RefFinder software were used to evaluate the stability of gene expression in both pyometra and healthy uterine samples. The results showed that the expression stability of the candidate gene in pyometra and healthy tissues differed. We showed that YWHAZ was the best reference gene, which could be used as an accurate internal control gene in canine pyometra studies. To further validate this recommendation, the expression profile of a target gene insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor gene (IGF1R) was investigated. We found that the expression of IGF1R was significantly altered when different reference genes were used. All reference genes identified in the present study will enable more accurate normalization of gene expression data in both pyometra infected and healthy uterine tissues.

27339468,"Serum availability affects expression of common house-keeping genes in colon adenocarcinoma cell lines: implications for quantitative real-time PCR studies.","Careful selection of housekeeping genes (HKG) is prerequisite to yield sound qPCR results. HKG expression varies in response to hypoxia but the effect of manipulations of serum availability, a common experimental procedure, remains unknown. Also, no data on HKG expression stability across colon adenocarcinoma lines that would aid selection of normalizers suitable for studies involving several lines are available. Thus, we evaluated the effect of serum availability on the expression of commonly used HKG (ACTB, B2M, GAPDH, GUSB, HPRT1, IPO8, MRPL19, PGK1, PPIA, RPLP0, RPS23, SDHA, TBP, UBC, and YWHAZ) in seven colon adenocarcinoma cell lines (Caco-2, DLD-1, HCT116, HT29, Lovo, SW480, and SW620). Sets of stably expressed line-specific and pan-line HKG were validated against absolutely quantified CDKN1A, TP53, and MDK transcripts. Both serum availability and line type affected HKG expression. UBC was fourfold down-regulated and HPRT1 1.75-fold up-regulated in re-fed HT29 cultures. Line-to-line variability in HKG expression was more pronounced than that caused by altering serum availability and could be found even between isogenic cell lines. PPIA, RPLP0, YWHAZ, and IPO8 were repeatedly highly ranked while ACTB, B2M, UBC, and PGK1 were ranked poorly. Normalization against PPIA/RPLP0/SDHA was found optimal for studies involving various colon adenocarcinoma cell lines subjected to manipulations of serum availability. We found HKG expression to vary, more pronouncedly by line type than growth conditions with significant differences also between isogenic cell lines. Although using line-specific normalizers remains optimal, a set of pan-line HKG that yields good estimation of relative expression of target genes was proposed.","0920-9069","Cytotechnology","(68) 2503-2517",2016,"Malgorzata","Krzystek-Korpacka","M","Department of Medical Biochemistry, Wroclaw Medical University, ul.

This phenomenon, commonly referred to as 'immune evasion,' represents a hallmark of cancers and results from a Darwinian selection of the fittest tumor clones. First reported in solid tumors, cancer immunoescape characterizes several hematological malignancies. The biological bases of cancer immunoescape have recently been disclosed and include: (i) impaired human leukocyte antigen-mediated cancer cell recognition (B2M, CD58, CTIIA, CD80/CD86, CD28 and CTLA-4 mutations); (ii) deranged apoptotic mechanisms (reduced pro-apoptotic signals and/or increased expression of anti-apoptotic molecules); and (iii) changes in the tumor microenvironment involving regulatory T cells and tumor-associated macrophages. These immune-escape mechanisms characterize both Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin (B and T cell) lymphomas and represent a promising target for new anti-tumor therapies. In the present review, the principles of cancer immunoescape and their role in human lymphomagenesis are illustrated. Current therapies targeting these pathways and possible applications for lymphoma treatment are also addressed.","1476-5551","Leukemia","(30) 1805-15",2016,"M","Pizzi","M","Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, USA."

Accumulating evidence suggests biological and genetic differences between subtypes of depression that are homogeneous in symptom presentation. We aimed to evaluate differences in serum protein profiles between persons with atypical and melancholic depressive subtypes, and compare these profiles with serum protein levels of healthy controls. We used the baseline data from the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety on 414 controls, 231 persons with a melancholic depressive subtype and 128 persons with an atypical depressive subtype for whom the proteomic data were available. Depressive subtypes were previously established using a data-driven analysis, and 171 serum proteins were measured on a multi-analyte profiling platform. Linear regression models were adjusted for several covariates and corrected for multiple testing using false discovery rate q-values. We observed differences in analytes between the atypical and melancholic subtypes (9 analytes, q<0.05) and between atypical depression and controls (23 analytes, q<0.05). Eight of the nine markers differing between the atypical and melancholic subtype overlapped with markers from the comparison between atypical subtype and controls (mesothelin, leptin, IGFBP1, IGFBP2, FABPa, insulin, C3 and B2M), and were mainly involved in cellular communication and signal transduction, and immune response. No markers differed significantly between the melancholic subtype and controls. To conclude, although some uncertainties exist in our results as a result of missing data imputation and lack of proteomic replication samples, many of the identified analytes are inflammatory or metabolic markers, which supports the notion of atypical depression as a syndrome characterized by metabolic disturbances and inflammation, and underline the importance and relevance of subtypes of depression in biological and genetic research, and potentially in the treatment of depression.","2158-3188","Translational psychiatry","(6) e851",2016,"F","Lamers","F","Department of Psychiatry and EMGO Institute for Health and Care Research, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands."
27484587,"Optimization of Reference Genes for Normalization of Reverse Transcription Quantitative Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction Results in Senescence Study of Mesenchymal Stem Cells.","Recently, it has been suggested that cellular senescence is associated with stem cell exhaustion, which reduces the regenerative potential of tissues and contributes to aging and age-related diseases. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) attract a large amount of attention in stem cell research and regeneration medicine because they possess multiple advantages and senescent MSCs could be one of the most useful stem cell models in aging studies. It is important to quantitatively evaluate senescence markers to both identify and study the mechanisms involved in MSC senescence. Reverse transcription quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) is currently the most widely used tool to quantify the mRNA levels of markers. However, no report has demonstrated the optimal reference genes that should be used to normalize RT-qPCR in senescence studies of MSCs. In this study, we compared 16 commonly used reference genes (GAPDH, ACTB, RPL13A, TBP, B2M, GUSB, RPLPO, YWHAZ, RPS18, EEF1A1, ATP5F1, HPRT1, PGK1, TFRC, UBC, and PPIA) in proliferating or replicative-senescent human adipose-derived MSCs (hAD-MSCs) that were isolated from seven healthy donors aged 29-59 years old. Three algorithms (geNorm, NormFinder, and BestKeeper) were used to determine the most optimal reference gene. The results showed that PPIA exhibited the most stable expression during senescence, while the widely used ACTB exhibited the lowest stability. We also confirmed that different reference genes lead to different evaluations of senescence markers. Our work ensures that results obtained from senescence studies of hAD-MSCs will be appropriately evaluated in both basic research and clinical trials.","1557-8534","Stem cells and development","(25) 1355-65",2016,"Xiaodong","Su","X","1 Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, School of Basic Medicine, Peking Union Medical College, Center of Excellence in Tissue Engineering, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences , Beijing, People's Republic of China ."

A 9 kDa fragment derived from β2-microglobulin (B2M) was identified and named shed 9 kDa B2M (sB2M-9). The primary structure of sB2M-9 was revealed to increase its pI value that potentially could play an important role in innate defense. sB2M-9 exhibits antibacterial activity against Gram positive Staphylococcus aureus (SA) but not against Gram negative Klebsiella pneumonia (KP). Upon its binding to SA, sB2M-9 induces clumps, a phenomenon not observed with B2M. Migration of THP-1 monocytes exposed to SA clumps was significantly greater than that to SA without clumps. sB2M-9 binds to SA, more likely as a chemokine, to facilitate THP-1 migration. As a whole, we demonstrated that REC release a novel chemokine with antibacterial activity that is shed from B2M to facilitate THP-1 migration.","2045-2322","Scientific reports","(6) 31035",2016,"Shean-Jaw","Chiou","SJ","Department of Biochemistry, College of Medicine, Kaohsiung Medical University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan."

ISIS 388626 increased 24-hour urinary glucose excretion dose dependently with 508.9 ± 781.45 mg/day in the 100-mg and 1299.8 ± 1833.4 mg/day in the 200-mg cohort, versus 88.7 ± 259.29 mg/day in the placebo group. ISIS 388626 induced a reversible increase in serum creatinine, with the largest effect after eight doses of ISIS 388626 (200 mg; 0.38 ± 0.089 mg/dl; 44% increase over baseline). Three subjects were discontinued as a result of creatinine increases. The renal clearance test revealed no indications for impairment of glomerular filtration or renal perfusion. The creatinine increases were accompanied by a rise in the levels of urinary renal damage markers [β-2-microglobulin (B2M), total protein, kidney injury molecule (KIM1), α-glutathione S-transferase (aGST), N-acetyl-β-(d)-glucosaminidase (NAG)]. Other treatment-related adverse events included mild injection site reactions occurring in 8-19% of the subjects. In conclusion, ISIS 388626 treatment induced glucosuria at a dose level of 200 mg/week. This intended pharmacological effect was small, amounting to approximately 1% of the total amount of filtered glucose. Changes in serum and urinary markers were indicative of transient renal dysfunction, most probably of tubular origin.

Also, we reported that IL-27, similar to IFN-γ, induces the expression of IL-18BP, IDO and PD-L1 immune regulatory molecules in human cancer cells. Here, a proteomic analysis reveals that IL-27 and IFN-γ display a broad overlap of functions on human ovarian cancer cells. Indeed, among 990 proteins modulated by either cytokine treatment in SKOV3 cells, 814 showed a concordant modulation by both cytokines, while a smaller number (176) were differentially modulated. The most up-regulated proteins were common to both IFN-γ and IL-27. In addition, functional analysis of IL-27-regulated protein networks highlighted pathways of interferon signaling and regulation, antigen presentation, protection from natural killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity, regulation of protein polyubiquitination and proteasome, aminoacid catabolism and regulation of viral protein levels.Importantly, we found that IL-27 induced HLA class I molecule expression in human cancer cells of different histotypes, including tumor cells showing very low expression. IL-27 failed only in a cancer cell line bearing a homozygous deletion in the B2M gene. Altogether, these data point out to a broad set of activities shared by IL-27 and IFN-γ, which are dependent on the common activation of the STAT1 pathway.

27727313,"Endogenous Reference Genes for Gene Expression Studies on Bicuspid Aortic Valve Associated Aortopathy in Humans.","Bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) disease is the most common congenital cardiac abnormality and predisposes patients to life-threatening aortic complications including aortic aneurysm. Quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) is one of the most commonly used methods to investigate underlying molecular mechanisms involved in aortopathy. The accuracy of the gene expression data is dependent on normalization by appropriate housekeeping (HK) genes, whose expression should remain constant regardless of aortic valve morphology, aortic diameter and other factors associated with aortopathy. Here, we identified an appropriate set of HK genes to be used as endogenous reference for quantifying gene expression in ascending aortic tissue using a spin column-based RNA extraction method. Ascending aortic biopsies were collected intra-operatively from patients undergoing aortic valve and/or ascending aortic surgery. These patients had BAV or tricuspid aortic valve (TAV), and the aortas were either dilated (≥4.5cm) or undilated. The cohort had an even distribution of gender, valve disease and hypertension. The expression stability of 12 reference genes were investigated (ATP5B, ACTB, B2M, CYC1, EIF4A2, GAPDH, SDHA, RPL13A, TOP1, UBC, YWHAZ, and 18S) using geNorm software.

27730344,"Expression of circulating miRNAs associated with lymphocyte differentiation and activation in CLL-another piece in the puzzle.","Expression of microRNAs is altered in cancer. Circulating miRNA level assessed in body fluids commonly reflects their expression in tumor cells. In leukemias, however, both leukemic and nonleukemic cells compose circulating miRNA expression profile of peripheral blood. The latter contribution to extracellular miRNA pool may result in specific microenvironmental signaling, which promotes proliferation and survival. In our study, we used qT-PCR to assay peripheral blood serum of 22 chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients for the expression of 84 miRNAs associated with activation and differentiation of B and T lymphocytes. Results were analyzed regarding the most important prognostic factors. We have found that the general expression of examined miRNAs in CLL patients was lower as compared to healthy volunteers. Only miR-34a-5p, miR31-5p, miR-155-5p, miR-150-5p, miR-15a-3p, and miR-29a-3p were expressed on a higher level. Alterations of expression observed in CLL patients involved miRNAs associated both with B and T lymphocyte differentiation and activation. The most important discriminating factors for all functional miRNA groups were trisomy 12, CD38 expression, B2M level, WBC, and NOTCH1 gene mutation. Correlation of expression of miRNAs related to T lymphocytes with prognostic factors proves their supportive function in a leukemic microenvironment. Further studies utilizing a larger test group of patients may warrant the identification of circulating miRNAs that are key players in intercellular interactions and should be considered in the design of microenvironment-targeted therapies.","1432-0584","Annals of hematology","(96) 33-50",2017,"Agata A","Filip","AA","Department of Cancer Genetics, Medical University of Lublin, Radziwiłłowska 11, 20-080, Lublin, Poland. aafilip@hotmail.com."
27835695,"Reference Genes for Addressing Gene Expression of Bladder Cancer Cell Models under Hypoxia: A Step Towards Transcriptomic Studies.","Highly aggressive, rapidly growing tumors contain significant areas of hypoxia or anoxia as a consequence of inadequate and/or irregular blood supply. During oxygen deprivation, tumor cells withstand a panoply of adaptive responses, including a shift towards anaerobic metabolism and the reprogramming of the transcriptome. One of the major mediators of the transcriptional hypoxic response is the hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1), whose stabilization under hypoxia acts as an oncogenic stimulus contributing to chemotherapy resistance, invasion and metastasis. Gene expression analysis by qRT-PCR is a powerful tool for cancer cells phenotypic characterization. Nevertheless, as cells undergo a severe transcriptome remodeling.in response to oxygen deficit, the precise identification of reference genes poses a significant challenge for hypoxic studies. Herein, we aim to establish the best reference genes for studying the effects of hypoxia on bladder cancer cells. Accordingly, three bladder cancer cell lines (T24, 5637, and HT1376) representative of two distinct carcinogenesis pathways to invasive cancer (FGFR3/CCND1 and E2F3/RB1) were used. Additionally, we have explored the most suitable control gene when addressing the influence of Deferoxamine Mesilate salt (DFX), an iron chelator often used to avoid the proteasomal degradation of HIF-1α, acting as an hypoxia-mimetic agent. Using bioinformatics tools (GeNorm and NormFinder), we have elected B2M and HPRT as the most stable genes for all cell lines and experimental conditions out of a panel of seven putative candidates (HPRT, ACTB, 18S, GAPDH, TBP, B2M, and SDHA). These observations set the molecular basis for future studies addressing the effect of hypoxia and particularly HIF-1α in bladder cancer cells.","1932-6203","PloS one","(11) e0166120",2016,"Luís","Lima","L","Experimental Pathology and Therapeutics Group - Research Center, Portuguese Institute of Oncology of Porto (IPO-Porto), 4200-072, Porto, Portugal."

Although rituximab therapy improves clinical outcome, some patients develop resistant DLBCL; however, the genetic alterations in these patients are not well documented. To identify the genetic background of refractory DLBCL, we conducted whole-exome sequencing and transcriptome sequencing for six patients with refractory and seven with responsive DLBCL. The average numbers of pathogenic somatic single nucleotide variants and indels in coding regions were 71 in refractory patients (range 28-120) and 38 (range 19-66) in responsive patients. Missense mutations of TP53 were exclusive in 50% (3/6) of refractory patients and involved the DNA-binding domain of TP53. All missense mutations of TP53 were accompanied by copy number deletions. RAB11FIP5, PRKCB, PRDM15, FNBP4, AHR, CEP128, BRE, DHX16, MYO6, and NMT1 mutations were recurrent in refractory patients. MYD88, B2M, SORCS3, and WDFY3 mutations were more frequent in refractory patients than in responsive patients. REL-BCL11A fusion was found in two refractory patients; one had both fusion and copy number gain. Recurrent copy gains of POU2AF1, SLC1A4, REL11, FANCL, CACNA1D, TRRAP, and CUX1 with significantly increased average expression were found in refractory patients. The expression profile revealed enriched gene sets associated with treatment resistance, including oxidative phosphorylation and ATP-binding cassette transporters.

Here we show that heterochronic blood exchange between young and old mice without sharing other organs, affects tissues within a few days, and leads to different outcomes than heterochronic parabiosis. Investigating muscle, liver and brain hippocampus, in the presence or absence of muscle injury, we find that, in many cases, the inhibitory effects of old blood are more pronounced than the benefits of young, and that peripheral tissue injury compounds the negative effects. We also explore mechanistic explanations, including the role of B2M and TGF-beta.

The evaluated HKGs included 18S ribosomal RNA (18S), 28S ribosomal RNA (28S), ribosomal protein L32 (RPL32), β-2-microglobulin (B2M), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), succinate dehydrogenase complex (SDHA), zeta polypeptide (YWHAZ), and hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase 1 (HPRT1). The HKGs expression stability data were analysed with two software packages, geNorm and NormFinder. The lowest stability values for geNorm suggests that YWHAZ and HPRT1 would be most optimal (M=0.31 and 0.32, respectively). Further, these two genes had the best pairwise stability value using NormFinder (geNorm V=0.085).

Whether and how MHC I-deficiency of pig donor tissues affects rejection after xenotransplantation has not been assessed. Beta2-microglobulin (B2M) is indispensable for the assembly of MHC I receptors and therefore provides an effective target to disrupt cell surface MHC I expression. Here, we report the one-step generation of mutant pigs with targeted disruptions in B2m by injection of porcine zygotes with B2m exon 2-specific TALENs. After germline transmission of mutant B2m alleles, we obtained F1 pigs with biallelic B2m frameshift mutations. F1 pigs lacked detectable B2M expression in tissues derived from the three germ layers, and their lymphocytes were devoid of MHC I surface receptors. Skin grafts from B2M deficient pigs exhibited remarkably prolonged survival on xenogeneic wounds compared to tissues of non-mutant littermates. Mutant founder pigs with bi-allelic disruption in B2m and B2M deficient F1 offspring did not display visible abnormalities, suggesting that pigs are tolerant to B2M deficiency. In summary, we show the efficient generation of pigs with germline mutations in B2m, and demonstrate a beneficial effect of donor MHC I-deficiency on xenotransplantation.","2045-2322","Scientific reports","(6) 38854",2016,"Yong","Wang","Y","Department of Laboratory Animal Science, College of Basic Medical Sciences, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing 400038, China."
28040849,"Rejection versus escape: the tumor MHC dilemma.","Most tumor cells derive from MHC-I-positive normal counterparts and remain positive at early stages of tumor development. T lymphocytes can infiltrate tumor tissue, recognize and destroy MHC class I (MHC-I)-positive cancer cells (""permissive"" phase I). Later, MHC-I-negative tumor cell variants resistant to T-cell killing emerge. During this process, tumors first acquire a heterogeneous MHC-I expression pattern and finally become uniformly MHC-I-negative. This stage (phase II) represents a ""non-permissive"" encapsulated structure with tumor nodes surrounded by fibrous tissue containing different elements including leukocytes, macrophages, fibroblasts, etc. Molecular mechanisms responsible for total or partial MHC-I downregulation play a crucial role in determining and predicting the antigen-presenting capacity of cancer cells. MHC-I downregulation caused by reversible (""soft"") lesions can be upregulated by TH1-type cytokines released into the tumor microenvironment in response to different types of immunotherapy. In contrast, when the molecular mechanism of the tumor MHC-I loss is irreversible (""hard"") due to a genetic defect in the gene/s coding for MHC-I heavy chains (chromosome 6) or beta-2-microglobulin (B2M) (chromosome 15), malignant cells are unable to upregulate MHC-I, remain undetectable by cytotoxic T-cells, and continue to grow and metastasize. Based on the tumor MHC-I molecular analysis, it might be possible to define MHC-I phenotypes present in cancer patients in order to distinguish between non-responders, partial/short-term responders, and likely durable responders. This highlights the need for designing strategies to enhance tumor MHC-I expression that would allow CTL-mediated tumor rejection.","1432-0851","Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII","(66) 259-271",2017,"Federico","Garrido","F","Servicio de Análisis Clínicos e Inmunología, UGC Laboratorio Clínico, Hospital Universitario Virgen de las Nieves, Av.

Accurate normalization of gene expression relies on good selection of reference genes and the best way to choose them appropriately is to follow the common rule of the ""Best 3"", at least three reference genes, three different validation software and three sample replicates. Analysis was performed on hASCs cultivated until the eleventh cell confluence using twelve candidate reference genes, initially selected from literature, whose stability was evaluated by the algorithms NormFinder, BestKeeper, RefFinder and IdealRef, a home-made version of GeNorm. The best gene panel (RPL13A, RPS18, GAPDH, B2M, PPIA and ACTB), determined in one patient by IdealRef calculation, was then investigated in other four donors. Although patients demonstrated a certain gene expression variability, we can assert that ACTB is the most unreliable gene whereas ribosomal proteins (RPL13A and RPS18) show minor inconstancy in their mRNA expression.

28337673,"Progression-Free Survival as a Surrogate for Overall Survival in Clinical Trials of Targeted Therapy in Advanced Solid Tumors.","Over the past 15 years, targeted therapy has revolutionized the systemic treatment of cancer. In parallel, there has been a growing debate on the choice of end points in clinical trials in oncology. This debate basically hinges on the choice between overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). PFS is advantageous because it is measured earlier than OS, requires a smaller sample size than OS to achieve the desired power, and is not influenced by cross-over. On the other hand, PFS is prone to measurement error and bias, and may not capture the entire treatment effect on the outcomes of most interest to patients with an incurable disease: a prolonged survival and improved quality of life. Therefore, how can we choose between two imperfect end points? The answer to this question would certainly be made easier if PFS could be demonstrated to be a valid surrogate for OS. The validation of a surrogate end point is best made using individual-patient data (IPD) from randomized trials, which allows for standardized assessments of the patient-level and the trial-level correlations between surrogate and final end points. Proper IPD meta-analytical evaluations for targeted agents have still been rare, and to our knowledge only three studies on this topic are currently available in the metastatic setting: one in breast cancer, one in colorectal cancer and one in lung cancer. Although these three studies suffer from limitations inherent to the availability of IPD and the design of the original clinical trials, they have not been able to validate PFS as surrogate for OS, because only modest correlations were found between these two end points, both at the patient and at the trial level. Even if properly conducted surrogate-endpoint evaluations have thus far been unsuccessful, these evaluations are a step in the right direction and can be expected to be applied on a much larger scale in the era of data sharing of clinical trials.","1179-1950","Drugs","(77) 713-719",2017,"Stefan","Michiels","S","Service de Biostatistique et d'Epidémiologie, Gustave Roussy, B2M RDC, 114 rue Edouard Vaillant, 94805, Villejuif Cedex, France. stefan.michiels@gustaveroussy.fr."

While immunohistochemical detection of PD-L1 expression in tumor cells, immune cells, or both has been introduced as predictive biomarker in several clinical trials, shortcomings and limitations of this approach were quickly recognized. As a single biomarker is unlikely to adequately reflect the complex interplay between immune cells and cancer, various genetic determinants of therapy success, including microsatellite instability, mutational burden, and PD-L1 amplification, are being investigated. Very recent work indicates that mutations in B2M, JAK1, and JAK2 render melanoma resistant to immune checkpoint blockade, thus serving as negative response predictors. Using the TCGA dataset, we performed a pan-cancer analysis of potentially damaging mutations in key genes implicated in antigen presentation and interferon-gamma signaling and investigated associations with transcript levels of immune checkpoint genes, cytolytic activity, and mutational burden. For B2M, JAK1, and JAK2, we observed overall mutation frequencies of 1.8%, 2%, and 2.6%, respectively, and found significant associations with mutational burden. On pathway level, melanoma as well as bladder, gastric, and lung cancer were most frequently affected by putative resistance mutations with mutation rates of 27%-50% in the antigen presentation pathway and of 16%-21% in the interferon signaling pathway. Our analysis suggests that a significant number of tumors harbor mutations that may negatively interfere with immune checkpoint inhibition, or confer a higher likelihood of resistance for which a second hit is ultimately required.

28494186,"Small interference ITGA6 gene targeting in the human thymic epithelium differentially regulates the expression of immunological synapse-related genes.","The thymus supports differentiation of T cell precursors. This process requires relocation of developing thymocytes throughout multiple microenvironments of the organ, mainly with thymic epithelial cells (TEC), which control intrathymic T cell differentiation influencing the formation and maintenance of the immunological synapse. In addition to the proteins of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), this structure is supported by several adhesion molecules. During the process of thymopoiesis, we previously showed that laminin-mediated interactions are involved in the entrance of T-cell precursors into the thymus, as well as migration of differentiating thymocytes within the organ. Using small interference RNA strategy, we knocked-down the ITGA6 gene (which encodes the CD49f integrin α-chain) in cultured human TEC, generating a decrease in the expression of the corresponding CD49f subunit, in addition to modulation in several other genes related to cell adhesion and migration. Thymocyte adhesion to TEC was significantly impaired, comprising both immature and mature thymocyte subsets. Moreover, we found a modulation of the MHC, with a decrease in membrane expression of HLA-ABC, in contrast with increase in the expression of HLA-DR. Interestingly, the knockdown of the B2M gene (encoding the β-2 microglobulin of the HLA-ABC complex) increased CD49f expression levels, thus unraveling the existence of a cross-talk event in the reciprocal control of CD49f and HLA-ABC. Our data suggest that the expression levels of CD49f may be relevant in the general control of MHC expression by TEC and consequently the corresponding synapse with developing thymocytes mediated by the T-cell receptor.","1933-6926","Cell adhesion & migration","(12) 152-167",2018,"Daiane Cristina F","Golbert","DCF","a Laboratory on Thymus Research, Oswaldo Cruz Institute , Oswaldo Cruz Foundation , Rio de Janeiro , Brazil."

We screened the coding microsatellites within B2M for somatic mutations in MMR-deficient CRCs and adenomas to determine associations with tumour subtypes, clinicopathological features and survival. Incident MMR-deficient CRCs from Australasian Colorectal Cancer Family Registry (ACCFR) and the Melbourne Collaborative Cohort Study participants (n = 144) and 63 adenomas from 41 MMR gene mutation carriers from the ACCFR were screened for somatic mutations within five coding microsatellites of B2M. Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for overall survival by B2M mutation status were estimated using Cox regression, adjusting for age at CRC diagnosis, sex, AJCC stage and grade. B2M mutations occurred in 30 (20.8%) of the 144 MMR-deficient CRCs (29% of the MLH1-methylated, 17% of the Lynch syndrome and 9% of the suspected Lynch CRCs). No B2M mutations were identified in the 63 adenomas tested. B2M mutations differed by site, stage, grade and lymphocytic infiltration although none reached statistical significance (p > 0.05). The HR for overall survival for B2M mutated CRC was 0.65 (95% CI 0.29-1.48) compared with B2M wild-type. We observed differences in B2M mutation status in MMR-deficient CRC by tumour subtypes, site, stage, grade, immune infiltrate and for overall survival that warrant further investigation in larger studies before B2M mutation status can be considered to have clinical utility.","1573-7292","Familial cancer","(17) 91-100",2018,"Mark","Clendenning","M","Colorectal Oncogenomics Group, Genetic Epidemiology Laboratory, Department of Pathology, The University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC, 3010, Australia."

Recently, therapies that harness the host immune system to fight cancer cells have successfully treated a subset of patients with solid tumors. These responses have been strong and durable but observed in subsets of patients. Work from our group and others has shown that epigenetic therapy, specifically inhibiting the silencing DNA methylation mark, activates immune signaling in tumor cells and can sensitize to immune therapy in murine models. Here we show that colon and ovarian cancer cell lines exhibit lower expression of transcripts involved in antigen processing and presentation to immune cells compared to normal tissues. In addition, treatment with clinically relevant low doses of DNMT inhibitors (that remove DNA methylation) increases expression of both antigen processing and presentation and Cancer Testis Antigens in these cell lines. We confirm that treatment with DNMT inhibitors upregulates expression of the antigen processing and presentation molecules B2M, CALR, CD58, PSMB8, PSMB9 at the RNA and protein level in a wider range of colon and ovarian cancer cell lines and treatment time points than had been described previously. In addition, we show that DNMTi treatment upregulates many Cancer Testis Antigens common to both colon and ovarian cancer.

The selection of stable endogenous control genes is an important step of any RT-qPCR study, as expression can vary depending on the experimental environment. Our objective was to identify endogenous control genes in circulating neutrophils isolated from cows during the peripartum period. To do this, we used microfluidics gene expression arrays (Fluidigm, San Francisco, CA) for RT-qPCR analysis. Selection of the endogenous control genes was based on previous research investigating gene expression in neutrophils. The selected genes included ACTB, B2M, G6PD, GAPDH, GCH1, GOLGA5, OSBPL2, PGK1, RPL13A, RPL19, RPS9, SDHA, SMUG1, SNRPA, TBP, UXT, and YWHAZ. Four genes (GAPDH, GOLGA5, PGK1, and UXT) did not provide satisfactory quantification results using the selected method and were therefore excluded from the analyses. The suitability of the remaining 13 genes for use as endogenous control genes was assessed using geNorm and Normfinder. The gene pair with the greatest stability using geNorm was RPL13A and RPL19, whereas Normfinder ranked RPL19 and YWHAZ as the most stable pair. The 2 genes deemed most suitable for the experimental design were RPL19 and YWHAZ, which were selected for subsequent gene expression analysis.

NormFinder analyses showed that the two most stable reference genes in response to POT and POT+N were 18S ribosomal RNA (18S rRNA), ribosomal protein L4 (RPL4) and HMBS, RPL4, respectively. BestKeeper analyses showed that 18S rRNA, RPL4 and HPRT1, HMBS were the two most stable reference genes for POT, and POT+N, respectively. Of the ten reference genes, all except B2M showed geNorm M <0.5, suggesting that they were stably expressed in the shell gland tissue. Consensus from these three programs suggested HPRT1 and HMBS could be used as the two most stable reference genes in the present study. Expression analyses of four candidate target genes with the two most and the two least stable genes showed that a combination of stable reference genes leads to more discriminable quantification of expression levels of target genes, while the least stable genes failed to do so. Therefore, HMBS and HPRT1 are recommended as the two most stable reference genes for the normalization of gene expression data at different stages of eggshell formation in brown-egg laying hens.

28813459,"β2-microglobulin gene duplication in cetartiodactyla remains intact only in pigs and possibly confers selective advantage to the species.","Several β2-microglobulin (B2M) -bound protein complexes undertake key roles in various immune system pathways, including the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn), cluster of differentiation 1 (CD1) protein, non-classical major histocompatibility complex (MHC), and well-known MHC class I molecules. Therefore, the duplication of B2M may lead to an increase in the biological competence of organisms to the environment. Based on the pig genome assembly SSC10.2, a segmental duplication of ~45.5 kb, encoding the entire B2M protein, was identified in pig chromosome 1. Through experimental validation, we confirmed the functional duplication of the B2M gene with a completely identical coding sequence between two copies in pigs. Considering the importance of B2M in the immune system, we performed the phylogenetic analysis of B2M duplication in ten mammalian species, confirming the presence of B2M duplication in cetartioldactyls, like cattle, sheep, goats, pigs and whales, but non-cetartiodactyl species, like mice, cats, dogs, horses, and humans. The density of long interspersed nuclear element (LINE) at the edges of duplicated blocks (39 to 66%) was found to be 2 to 3-fold higher than the average (20.12%) of the pig genome, suggesting its role in the duplication event. The B2M mRNA expression level in pigs was 12.71 and 7.57 times (2-ΔΔCt values) higher than humans and mice, respectively. However, we were unable to experimentally demonstrate the difference in the level of B2M protein because species specific anti-B2M antibodies are not available. We reported, for the first time, the functional duplication of the B2M gene in animals. The identification of partially remaining duplicated B2M sequences in the genomes of only cetartiodactyls indicates that the event was lineage specific. B2M duplication could be beneficial to the immune system of pigs by increasing the availability of MHC class I light chain protein, B2M, to complex with the proteins encoded by the relatively large number of MHC class I heavy chain genes in pigs.

Therefore, the present study was carried out to elucidate the differential expression of PRR and some of the cytokine genes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of indigenous chicken breeds such as Ghagus and Nicobari and an exotic chicken breed, White Leghorn (WLH). The stability of expression of reference genes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of 3 breeds was first determined using NormFinder and BestKeeper programs. NormFinder determined B2M and G6PDH reference genes as the best combination with stability value of 0.38. Out of total 14 genes studied, expression of ten genes was found to be significantly different among 3 breeds after normalization with these reference genes. Ghagus breed showed higher level of expression of TLR1LB, TLR7, NOD1, NOD5, B-Lec, IFNβ, IL1β, and IL8 genes when compared to Nicobari breed. Further, Ghagus showed higher expression of TLR1LB, MDA5, LGP2, B-Lec, IL1β, and IL8 genes as compared to WLH breed. Higher expression of LGP2 and MDA5 genes was observed in Nicobari compared to the WLH breed while higher expression of TLR7, NOD1, NOD5, and IFNβ genes was observed in WLH as compared to Nicobari breed. No difference was observed in the expression of TLR1LA, TLR3, B-NK, and IFNα genes among 3 breeds.

As immunologic characterizations, prognostic and predictive of immunotherapeutic clinical response in other cancers, are not fully described for benign and malignant NF1-related tumors, we sought to define their immunologic profiles. We determined the expression of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A/-B/-C, β-2-microglobulin (B2M), and T cell inhibitory ligands PD-L1 and CTLA-4 by microarray gene analysis and flow cytometry.

The molecular alterations leading to the onset and the spreading of these diseases are still unknown. In a previous work we identified a five-gene signature able to distinguish intracranially BSE-infected macaques from healthy ones, with SERPINA3 showing the most prominent dysregulation. We analyzed 128 suitable frontal cortex samples, from prion-affected patients (variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) n = 20, iatrogenic CJD (iCJD) n = 11, sporadic CJD (sCJD) n = 23, familial CJD (gCJD) n = 17, fatal familial insomnia (FFI) n = 9, Gerstmann-Sträussler-Scheinker syndrome (GSS)) n = 4), patients with Alzheimer disease (AD, n = 14) and age-matched controls (n = 30). Real Time-quantitative PCR was performed for SERPINA3 transcript, and ACTB, RPL19, GAPDH and B2M were used as reference genes. We report SERPINA3 to be strongly up-regulated in the brain of all human prion diseases, with only a mild up-regulation in AD. We show that this striking up-regulation, both at the mRNA and at the protein level, is present in all types of human prion diseases analyzed, although to a different extent for each specific disorder. Our data suggest that SERPINA3 may be involved in the pathogenesis and the progression of prion diseases, representing a valid tool for distinguishing different forms of these disorders in humans.","2045-2322","Scientific reports","(7) 15637",2017,"S","Vanni","S","Laboratory of Prion Biology, Department of Neuroscience, SISSA, Trieste, Italy."

In this study, with an aim to identify reliable reference genes for quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) in golden pompano, we evaluated the expression stability of eight housekeeping genes in the presence and absence of poly I:C stimulation in eight tissues. The PCR data was analyzed by geNorm and NormFinder algorithms. The results showed that the expression of all the examined genes exhibited tissue-dependent variations. When under normal physiological condition, geNorm and NormFinder identified B2M and 18S as suitable genes. When studying gene expression under conditions of poly I:C stimulation, the selection of the internal controls should be selected on a tissue basis. At 12 h stimulation, geNorm ranked Actin/UBCE, Actin/B2M, UBCE/B2M, Actin/UBCE, RPL13/B2M, UBCE/GAPDH, B2M/RPL13, and UBCE/B2M, respectively, as the most stably expressed genes in liver, spleen, kidney, gill, intestine, heart, muscle, and brain. Comparable ranking orders were produced by NormFinder. Similar results were obtained at 48 h stimulation. Taken together, these results indicate that B2M and 18S are the most stable gene across tissue types under normal physiological conditions. However, during poly I:C stimulation, no single gene or single pair of genes in the examined set of housekeeping genes can serve as a universal reference across all tissue types. If one gene is preferred, B2M, B2M, UBCE, Actin, B2M/RPL13, B2M, B2M, and RPL13 may be used in spleen, kidney, liver, gill, intestine, brain, muscle, and heart of golden pompano, respectively.","1505-1773","Polish journal of veterinary sciences","(20) 583-594",2017,"X J","Chen","XJ","University, P.R."

However, little is known about the mechanisms underpinning the unique pathogenesis of ALVJ. In this study, we investigated the gene expression profiles of ALVJ-infected chicken cells and performed a comprehensive analysis of the long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in CEF cells using RNA-Seq. As a result, 36 differentially expressed lncRNAs and 91 genes (FC > 2 and q-values < 0.05) were identified. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that these differentially expressed genes are involved in the innate immune response. Target prediction analysis revealed that these lncRNAs may act in cis or trans and affect the expression of genes which are involved in the anti-viral innate immune responses. Toll-like receptor, RIG-I receptor, NOD-like receptor and JAK-STAT signaling pathways were enriched. Notably, the induced expression of innate immunity genes, including B2M, DHX58, IFI27L2, IFIH1, IRF10, ISG12(2), MX, OAS*A, RSAD2, STAT1, TLR3, IL4I1, and IRF1 (FC > 2 and correlation > 0.95), were highly correlated with the upregulation of several lncRNAs, including MG066618, MG066617, MG066601, MG066629, MG066609 and MG066616.

We have demonstrated previously that three full-length flagellins of Treponema pallidum, namely FlaB1, FlaB2 and FlaB3, did have diagnostic value in the serodiagnosis of syphilis. Here, we selected and constructed three recombinant fragments of each complete FlaB, both the conserved N-terminal and the C-terminal region, and the middle variable part, with the goal of exploring fragments unique to Treponema pallidum for use as antigen targets in a fragment-based serological test. The diagnostic performance of fragments was evaluated using different panels of serum specimens (= 332) by indirect IgG enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The data showed that all the conserved fragments exhibited excellent sensitivities (91.1-95.0%) but poor specificities (64.1-78.4%), while the three middle regions demonstrated higher sensitivities and specificities for detecting IgG antibody, with 92.7% and 96.1% for FlaB1M ('B1M'), 91.6% and 94.8% for B2M, and 95.0% and 100% for B3M, respectively. In comparison, the sensitivity and specificity of Architect Syphilis TP was found to be 95.5% and 94.8%, respectively.

29231123,"Urinary protein biomarkers of kidney injury in patients receiving cisplatin chemotherapy.","Despite recent progress in the development of novel approaches to treat cancer, traditional antineoplastic drugs, such as cisplatin, remain a mainstay of regimens targeting solid tumors. Use of cisplatin is limited by acute kidney injury, which occurs in approximately 30% of patients. Current clinical measures, such as serum creatinine and estimated glomerular filtration rate, are inadequate in their ability to detect acute kidney injury, particularly when there is only a moderate degree of injury. Thus, there is an urgent need for improved diagnostic biomarkers to predict nephrotoxicity. There is also interest by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to validate and implement new biomarkers to identify clinical and subclinical acute kidney injury in patients during the drug approval process. This minireview provides an overview of the current literature regarding the utility of urinary proteins (albumin, beta-2-microglobulin, N-acetyl-D-glucosaminidase, kidney injury molecule-1, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin, and cystatin C) as biomarkers for cisplatin-induced AKI. Many of the well-studied urinary proteins (KIM-1, NGAL, B2M, albumin) as well as emerging biomarkers (calbindin, monocyte chemotactic protein-1, and trefoil factor 3) display distinct patterns of time-dependent excretion after cisplatin administration. Implementation of these biomarker proteins in the oncology clinic has been hampered by a lack of validation studies. To address these issues, large head-to-head studies are needed to fully characterize time-dependent responses and establish accurate cutoff values and ranges, particularly in cancer patients. Impact statement There is growing interest in using urinary protein biomarkers to detect acute kidney injury in oncology patients prescribed the nephrotoxic anticancer drug cisplatin. We aim to synthesize and organize the existing literature on biomarkers examined clinically in patients receiving cisplatin-containing chemotherapy regimens. This minireview highlights several proteins (kidney injury molecule-1, beta-2-microglobulin, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin, calbindin, monocyte chemotactic protein-1, trefoil factor 3) with the greatest promise for detecting cisplatin-induced acute kidney injury in humans. A comprehensive review of the existing literature may aid in the design of larger studies needed to implement the clinical use of these urinary proteins as biomarkers of kidney injury.","1535-3699","Experimental biology and medicine (Maywood, N.J.)","(243) 272-282",2018,"Blessy","George","B","1 Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, Ernest Mario School of Pharmacy, Piscataway, NJ 08854, USA."
29289361,"The pathobiology of primary testicular diffuse large B-cell lymphoma: Implications for novel therapies.","Primary testicular lymphomas (PTL) are the most prevalent type of testicular cancer arising in men over the age of 60. PTL accounts for approximately 1-2% of all non-Hodgkin lymphomas and most present with localized disease but despite this, outcome is poor. The majority of cases represent an extranodal manifestation of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), known as primary testicular DLBCL (PT-DLBCL). Gene expression profiling has established that over 75% of PT-DLBCLs resemble the activated B-cell-like (ABC) or non-germinal center subtype of nodal DLBCL. In distilling the specific mutational landscape and immunophenotypic profiles, immune-escape and sustained signalling emerge as prominent features of PT-DLBCL. These include genomic alterations arising within the core components of antigen presentation (CIITA, B2M, and HLA loci) and structural rearrangements of programmed death ligands 1 (CD274) and 2 (PDCD1LG2). Enrichment for somatic mutations within NF-κB pathway genes (MYD88, CD79B, NFKBIZ, BCL10, and MALT1) also feature prominently in PT-DLBCL. Taken together, the unique molecular and clinical characteristics of PT-DLBCL have informed on aspects of the distinct disease biology of this organotypic lymphoma that may guide rational therapeutic strategies.","1532-1681","Blood reviews","(32) 249-255",2018,"David D W","Twa","DDW","Department of Lymphoid Cancer Research, BC Cancer Agency, Vancouver, BC, Canada; Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada."

The exonuclease domain of POLE executes a proofreading function that decreases the mutation rate during DNA replication by an estimated of one to two orders. The high mutation burden resulting from its loss of function could create a load of neo-antigens that would put the neoplastic cells in severe disadvantage of an immune attack if properly presented to the immune system.

Objective: Here we considered correlations among serum levels of IL-10, stage of disease and clinical laboratory disease markers in Iranian MM patients to investigate whether the interleukin might have prognostic significance. Materials and Methods: In this cross-sectional study, a total of 60 subjects (40 patients and 20 controls) were recruited. After preliminary laboratory tests, disease stage was evaluated and serum levels of IL-10 were measured using an enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Results: The mean concentration of serum IL-10 in patients (2.39±0.82 ng/ ml) was significantly higher (p<0.0001) than that in healthy controls (0.34±0.15 ng/ml). A positive and significant correlation (p<0.0001) was observed with the disease stage. The highest plasma cell proportions were recorded for MM stage III patients (68.8±9.21%), differing significantly from those of stage I patients (50.0±10.0%; p=0.011). The Beta-2 microglobulin value in stage III patients (7.7±1.13mg/l) was significantly higher than in those with stage II (4.31±0.64 mg/l; p<0.0001) and stage I (2.8±0.4 mg/l; p<0.0001). There was also a positive and significant correlation (p=0.002) between IL-10 levels and B2M. A trend (p=0.06) for positive correlation was observed between IL-10 levels and plasma cells. Conclusions: The correlation of IL-10 with disease stage and markers of disease activity indicates important roles in MM pathogenesis and progression. Therefore, measurement of serum IL-10 might be helpful for predicting stage and clinical management of MM.","2476-762X","Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP","(19) 27-32",2018,"Ramin","Shekarriz","R","Department of Hematology and Oncology, Gastrointestinal Cancer Research Center, Mazandaran University of medical sciences, Sari, Iran.

The application of SNM has been suggested for high selectivity of biomolecules in a variety of medical filtration applications. The aim of this study was to rigorously quantify the differences in sieving between slit pore SNM and more commonly modeled cylindrical pore membranes, including effects of the extended Derjaguin, Landau, Verwey, and Overbeek (XDLVO) interactions. Applying equations derived for SNM in previous work, we compare the partition coefficient of slit and cylindrical pore membranes while accounting for both steric and XDLVO interactions. Simple, steric approximations demonstrate that slit pore membranes exhibit significantly lower partition coefficients than cylindrical pore models. Incorporating XDLVO interactions results in an even more marked difference between slit pore and cylindrical pore membranes. These partition coefficients were used to evaluate changes in beta-2-microglobulin (B2M) selectivity. The data demonstrate that XDLVO interactions increase the selectivity advantage that slit pores possess over cylindrical pores, particularly for larger values of the acid-base decay constant. Finally, the bovine serum albumin (BSA) to B2M selectivity ratio was investigated. The selectivity ratio appears larger in slit pores than cylindrical pores for all cases, indicating that slit pores are particularly well suited for hemofiltration applications. The results of this study have significant implications for the application of SNM in membrane processes where highly selective separation of biomolecules is desirable.","1095-7103","Journal of colloid and interface science","(517) 176-181",2018,"Benjamin J","Feinberg","BJ","Department of Bioengineering and Therapeutic Sciences, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA."

The importance of this study stems from the fact that riverine buffaloes are major dairy species of Indian sub-continent and the information generated here will be of great interest to the investigators engaged in functional genomic studies of this important livestock species. In this study, an effort was made to evaluate a panel of 10 candidate reference genes (glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), beta- actin (ACTB), ubiquitously expressed transcript (UXT), ribosomal protein S15 (RPS15), ribosomal protein L-4 (RPL4), ribosomal protein S9 (RPS9), ribosomal protein S23 (RPS23), hydroxymethylbilane synthase (HMBS), β2 Microglobulin (β2M) and eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1 alpha 1 (EEF1A1) across 12 tissues (mammary gland, kidney, spleen, liver, heart, intestine, ovary, lung, muscle, brain, subcutaneous fat and testis) of riverine buffaloes. In addition to overall analysis, tissue wise evaluation of expression stability of individual RG was also performed. Three different algorithms provided in geNorm, NormFinder and BestKeeper softwares were used to evaluate the stability of 10 potential reference genes from different functional classes. The M-value given by geNorm ranged from 0.9797 (RPS9 and UXT) to 1.7362 (RPS15). From the most stable to the least stable, genes were ranked as: UXT/RPS9> RPL4> RPS23> EEF1A1> ACTB> HMBS> GAPDH> B2M> RPS15. While NormFinder analysis ranked the genes as: UXT> RPS23> RPL4> RPS9> EEF1A1> HMBS> ACTB> β2M> GAPDH> RPS15. Based on the crossing point SD value and range of fold change expression, BestKeeper analysis ranked the genes as: RPS9> RPS23/UXT> RPL4> GAPDH> EEF1A1> ACTB> HMBS> β2M> RPS15. Overall the study has identified RPS23, RPS9, RPL4 and UXT genes to be the most stable and appropriate RGs that could be utilized for normalization of transcriptional data in various tissues of buffaloes.

The birds were divided into six equal groups as follow: control (basal diet, BD), BD+Pb (100 mg/kg diet), BD+YSE (100 mg/kg diet), BD+YSE (200 mg/kg diet), BD+Pb (100 mg/kg diet) +YSE (100 mg/kg diet) and BD+ Pb (100 mg/kg diet) + YSE (200 mg/kg diet). Pb induced a significant reduction in superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activities and reduced glutathione (GSH) level. While, increased protein carbonyl (PC) and malondialdehyde (MDA) content in tissues of exposed birds. Pb increased level of 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity in serum. YSE significantly reduced the Pb -induced oxidative stress in co-treated groups especially at 200 mg/kg diet. YSE could modulate the Pb -induced decreased urea, creatinine and beta-2 microglobulin (B2M) levels. YSE200 was found to be better than the YSE100 in decreasing levels of inflammatory markers including tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α), nitric oxide (NO), transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Furthermore, YSE significantly regulates glucose homeostasis in co-exposed quails. Pb residues were found to be significantly higher in kidney and pancreas tissues of Pb group compared to other groups. YES decreased the expression of metallothionein-1 in the renal and pancreatic tissues, while elevated insulin expression in the pancreatic cells by immunostaining in co-exposed groups. In conclusion, the present results conclusively demonstrate the potential modulatory effect of YSE against the Pb-induced toxic effects in different organs of Japanese quails.","1090-2414","Ecotoxicology and environmental safety","(156) 311-321",2018,"Mayada R","Farag","MR","Forensic Medicine and Toxicology Department, Veterinary Medicine Faculty, Zagazig University, Zagazig 44519, Egypt.

We measured the above parameters in 58 patients with active MM. All circulating markers were significantly higher in MM patients compared to controls (p < 0.001 for all cases), and all values were increasing in parallel with disease stage (p < 0.001 for all cases). Positive correlations between FLT3-L were noted with serum levels of BAFF (p < 0.003), IL-6 (p < 0.002), CRP (p < 0.0001), LDH (p < 0.001), and BM Ki-67 PI (p = 0.012), whereas only trends of correlation were noted with the B2M value and the percentage of infiltration. It seems that the increased serum levels of circulating FLT3-L, in parallel with MM activity, reflect their increased presence in the bone marrow microenvironment, probably as an effect of increased angiogenesis and myelosuppression. Consequently, they are potential markers of disease activity.","0893-9675","Critical reviews in oncogenesis","(22) 255-262",2017,"Maria","Kokonozaki","M","Hematology Laboratory, University Hospital of Heraklion, Heraklion, Greece."

Although contact-dependent mechanisms and paracrine factors are thought to collaborate in governing the MSCs-based effects on tumors progression, the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. In particular, the involvement of MSCs-derived cytokines in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) has not been clarified. In this study, we observed that β2-Microglobulin (B2M) is highly expressed in MSCs but scarcely in ESCC cells. Based on the previously described EMT promoting effect of B2M, we investigated the in vitro effect of MSCs-derived B2M on the EMT of ESCC cells, and discovered its subsequent enhancing effects on cell mobility and tumor-initiation. Further xenograft transplantation experiments confirmed the in vivo induction of tumor-initiation by MSCs-derived B2M. Noteworthy, we showed that the B2M expression positively correlated with poor prognosis. The fact that B2M is primarily expressed by the stroma of the ESCC tissue strengthens our hypothesis that in ESCC, MSCs-derived B2M promotes tumor-initiation and invasion via enhancing EMT, resulting in an adverse prognosis for the patients. Our results will be valuable for the prediction of the development and treatment of ESCC.","2045-2322","Scientific reports","(8) 5422",2018,"Junjie","Wang","J","Center for Stem Cell Biology and Tissue Engineering, The Key Laboratory for Stem Cells and Tissue Engineering, Ministry of Education, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China."

Allogeneic universal chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells can be produced by disrupting T cell receptor (TCR) and beta-2-microglobulin (B2M) in CAR T cells or by directly knocking in a CAR at the disrupted TRAC locus. The anti-tumor function can be further boosted by simultaneous ablation of PD-1 and CTLA-4. The anti-tumor activities and safety of TCR-transferred T cells can be improved by knocking out endogenous TCR, which avoids the use of affinity-enhanced TCRs that may lose specificity and cause severe adverse effects. Therefore, CRISPR/Cas9 technology holds enormous promise to advance the field of adoptive cell therapy.","2452-3186","Current research in translational medicine","(66) 39-42",2018,"Xiaojun","Liu","X","Center for Cellular Immunotherapies, University of Pennsylvania Cancer Center, Philadelphia, PA 19104, United States."

Based on the crucial role of hippocampal neurogenesis disturbance in the process of depression and anxiety, the aim of the present study is to investigate whether B2M leads to depressive- and anxiety-like behaviors. We found that 6 days after intracerebroventricular injection with B2M (0.3 μg), the immobility times of rats in the tail suspension test and the forced swimming test were increased, the swimming and climbing time in the forced swimming test was decreased, and the latency to feed in the novelty-suppressed feeding test was increased, indicating that B2M induces depressive-like behaviors. In addition, in the elevated plus maze test, B2M-treated rats displayed obvious decline in the number of entries into and the proportion of time spent in the open arm, while the number of total arm entries was no change, which indicated that B2M induces anxiety-like behaviors. Our present findings suggest that target B2M might represent a novel approach for treatment of depression and anxiety.","1932-6203","PloS one","(13) e0198027",2018,"Ping","Zhang","P","Department of Neurology, Affiliated Nanhua Hospital, University of South China, Hengyang, Hunan, China."
29857068,"Genomic Analyses Identify Recurrent Alterations in Immune Evasion Genes in Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma, Leg Type.","Cutaneous diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCLs) are aggressive lymphomas with a poor prognosis. To elucidate their genetic bases, we analyzed exome sequencing of 37 cutaneous DLBCLs, including 31 DLBCLs, leg type (DLBCL-LT) and 6 cutaneous DLBCLs-not otherwise specified (DLBCL-NOS). As reported previously, 77% of DLBCL-LT harbor NF-κB-activating MYD88 mutations. In nearly all MYD88-wild-type DLBCL-LT, we found cancer-promoting mutations that either activate the NF-κB pathway through alternative genes (NFKBIE or REL) or activate other canonical cancer pathways (BRAF, MED12, PIK3R1, and STAT3). After NF-κB, the second most commonly mutated pathway putatively enables immune evasion via mutations predicted to downregulate antigen processing (B2M, CIITA, HLA) or T-cell co-stimulation (CD58). DLBCL-LT have little genetic overlap with the genetically heterogeneous DLBCL-NOS. Instead, they resemble primary central nervous system and testicular large B-cell lymphomas (primary central nervous system lymphomas and primary testicular lymphomas). Like primary central nervous system lymphomas/primary testicular lymphomas, 40% of DLBCL-LT (vs. 0% of DLBCLs-not otherwise specified) harbored PDL1/PDL2 translocations, which lead to overexpression of PD-L1 or PD-L2 in 50% of the cases. Collectively, these data broaden our understanding of cutaneous DLBCLs and suggest novel therapeutic approaches (e.g., BRAF or PI3K inhibitors). Additionally, they suggest novel treatment paradigms, wherein DLBCL-LT can be targeted with strategies (e.g., immune checkpoint blockers) currently being developed for genomically similar primary central nervous system lymphomas/primary testicular lymphomas.","1523-1747","The Journal of investigative dermatology","(138) 2365-2376",2018,"Xiaolong Alan","Zhou","XA","Department of Dermatology, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, Illinois, USA."

MATERIAL AND METHODS Biochemical tests were performed before surgery (pre-therapy) and after surgery (post-therapy) in 16 children with congenital scoliosis and congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract. Thirty-two healthy children were matched for age, sex, and weight (healthy controls). General renal function tests included serum electrolytes, creatinine, urea, cystatin C, and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Tests for early renal changes included N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAG), urine microalbumin, serum transferrin, immunoglobulin G (IgG), urinary alpha-1-microglobulin (A1M), and beta-2-microglobulin (B2M). RESULTS Sixteen patients with congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract included eight boys (mean age, 11.38±2.00 years) and eight girls (mean age, 11.00±2.78 years). There were no significant differences in renal function between the pre-therapy and post-therapy groups (P>0.05), or between the three groups (pre-therapy, post-therapy, and healthy controls). In the pre-therapy group, there were significant differences in IgG, A1M, NAG, and serum phosphate levels between boys and girls, urine microalbumin was significantly increased in girls, but not boys (P<0.05). There were no significant differences between the pre-therapy group and post-therapy group (P>0.05). CONCLUSIONS Routine tests of renal function were normal in children with congenital scoliosis and congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract, but early changes in renal function occurred before surgical treatment, indicating long-term follow-up of renal function is recommended.","1643-3750","Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research","(24) 4667-4678",2018,"Zhengchao","Gao","Z","Department of Othopaedics, Second Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China (mainland)."

New noninvasive markers are still needed for the early detection of DN before identifiable alternations in kidney function or urine albumin excretion occurs. A C18 plate and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) were used to compare the urinary protein profiles of 238 subjects from the following 4 groups: patients with type 2 diabetic (T2D) with microalbuminuria, patients with DM without micro- or macroalbuminuria, patients with micro- or macroalbuminuria due to nondiabetic disease, and healthy controls. β2-microglobulin (B2M) and Clara-cell protein (CC16) were found to be highly released in the urine of patients with proteinuria due to nondiabetic or diabetic diseases. In differentiating nephropathy from healthy subject, the B2M and CC16 markers have a combined sensitivity and specificity of 77.3% and 91.8%, respectively. In distinguishing T2D with microalbuminuria from T2D patients, the combined markers have sensitivity and specificity of 66% and 73%, respectively. The predictive ability of B2M and CC16 for early renal functional decline (ERFD) was validated in 125 T2D patients with a follow-up times. The odds ratio (OR) of combined B2M and CC16 markers for developing ERFD was 7.59 (95% CI: 1.97-29.24). The detection of B2M and CC16 with the C18 plate-MALDI-TOF MS approach could be an attractive and practical assay for rapid diagnosis of nephropathy in nondiabetic/diabetic patients and as a predictor of ERFD among T2D patients who had not manifested significant kidney disease at baseline.","1932-6203","PloS one","(13) e0200945",2018,"Chao-Jung","Chen","CJ","Proteomics Core Laboratory, Department of Medical Research, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan."
30069817,"Identification of appropriate reference genes for local immune-related studies in Morada Nova sheep infected with Haemonchus contortus.","Due to the great economic impact of Haemonchus contortus on sheep farming, there is an increasing number of studies addressing host resistance against this nematode, including identification of directly related immune mechanisms. In this context, relative gene expression by RT-qPCR have been largely used, due to its rapidity, high sensitivity, specificity, and reproducibility. Although, appropriate reference gene selection is crucial for accurate interpretation of results. In this study, five reference genes (GAPDH, G6PDH, YWHAZ, ACTB, and B2M) were tested for expression stability in abomasum (fundic and pyloric regions) and abomasal lymph nodes of Morada Nova sheep classified as resistant (n = 5) or susceptible (n = 5) to H. contortus infection in a flock of 151 animals. GAPDH combined with YWHAZ were selected as reference genes for abomasal fundic region and abomasal lymph nodes, whereas YWHAZ was the most stable gene for abomasal pyloric region. These genes presented the lowest intra- and inter-group variations and, consequently, highest stability. In contrast, expression of G6PDH was the least stable in all tissues. The impact of reference gene selection was demonstrated by relative quantification of a pro-inflammatory cytokine (TNFα) in abomasal fundic region. Significant differences in TNFα expression levels between resistant and susceptible groups were only observed when the most stable genes (GAPDH combined with YWHAZ) or GAPDH were used as reference genes, whereas no significant differences were observed when other tested reference genes were used. It was demonstrated that normalization of expression data using inappropriate reference genes may significantly influence interpretation results.","1573-4978","Molecular biology reports","(45) 1253-1262",2018,"João Henrique Barbosa","Toscano","JHB","Universidade Estadual Paulista Júlio de Mesquita Filho, Via de Acesso Prof. Paulo Donato Castellane, s/n, Jaboticabal, SP, 14884-900, Brazil. joaoh.toscano@gmail.com."

When applied to genome editing using CRISPR/Cas9 along with single stranded DNA oligonucleotide (ssODN) template in human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), up to 42.1% HDR rate was achieved, drastically higher than many reported before. We demonstrated that the high HDR efficiency can be utilized to increase the gene ablation rate in cells relevant to clinical applications, by knocking-out β2-microglobulin (B2M) in primary human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs, 37.3% to 80.2%), and programmed death-1 (PD-1) in primary human T cells (42.6% to 58.6%).

30087457,"Novel cell enrichment technique for robust genetic analysis of archival classical Hodgkin lymphoma tissues.","Approximately 15% of patients with classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) die after relapse or progressive disease. Comprehensive genetic characterization is required to better understand its molecular pathology and improve management. However, genetic information on cHL is hard to obtain mainly due to rare malignant Hodgkin- and Reed-Sternberg cells (HRSC), whose overall frequencies in the affected tissues ranges from 0.1 to 10%. Therefore, enrichment of neoplastic cells is necessary for the majority of genetic investigations. We have developed a new high-throughput method for marker-based enrichment of archival formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue-derived HRSC nuclei by fluorescence-assisted flow sorting (FACS) and successfully applied it on ten cHL cases. Genomic DNA extracted from sorted nuclei was used for targeted high-throughput sequencing (HTS) of 68 genes that are frequently affected in lymphomas. Chromosomal copy number aberrations were investigated by the Agilent SurePrint 180k microarray. Our method enabled HRSC nuclei enrichment to 40-90% in sorted populations. This level of enrichment was sufficient for reliable identification of tumor-specific mutations and copy number aberrations. Genetic analysis revealed that components of JAK-STAT signaling pathway were affected in all investigated tumors by frequent mutations of SOCS1 and STAT6 as well as copy number gains of JAK2. Involvement of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) pathway compounds was evident from recurrent gains of the locus containing the REL gene and mutations in TNFAIP3 and CARD11. Finally, genetic alterations of PD-L1 and B2M suggested immune evasion as mechanisms of oncogenesis in some patients. In this work, we present a new method for HRSC enrichment from FFPE tissue blocks by FACS and demonstrate the feasibility of a wide-scale genetic analysis by cutting-edge molecular methods. Our work opens the door to a large resource of archived clinical cHL samples and lays foundation to more complex studies aimed to answer important biological and clinical questions that are critical to improve cHL management.","1530-0307","Laboratory investigation; a journal of technical methods and pathology","(98) 1487-1499",2018,"Darius","Juskevicius","D","University Hospital Basel, Institute of Pathology, Basel, Switzerland."
30145665,"HLA class I alterations in breast carcinoma are associated with a high frequency of the loss of heterozygosity at chromosomes 6 and 15.","HLA class I (HLA-I) molecules play a crucial role in the presentation of tumor antigenic peptides to CD8+ T cells. Tumor HLA-I loss provides a route of immune escape from T cell-mediated killing. We analyzed HLA-I expression in 98 cryopreserved breast cancer tissues using a broad panel of anti-HLA-I antibodies. Genomic HLA-I typing was performed using DNA obtained from autologous normal breast tissue. Analysis of the loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in the HLA-I region of chromosome 6 (LOH-6) and in the β2-microglobulin (B2M) region of chromosome 15 (LOH-15) was done by microsatellite amplification of DNA isolated from microdissected tumor areas. B2M gene sequencing was done using this DNA form HLA-I-negative tumors. Immunohistological analysis revealed various types of HLA-I alterations in 79 tumors (81%), including total HLA-I loss in 53 cases (54%) and partial loss in 16 samples (14%). In 19 cases (19%), HLA-I expression was positive. Using microsatellite analysis, we detected LOH in 36 cases out of 92 evaluated (39%), including 15 samples with only LOH-6, 14 with LOH-15, and seven tumors with LOH-6 and LOH-15 at the same time. Remarkably, we detected LOH-6 in eight tumors with positive HLA-I immunolabeling. We did not find any B2M mutations in HLA-I-negative breast tumors. In conclusion, LOH at chromosomes 6 and 15 has a high incidence in breast cancer and occurs in tumors with different HLA-I immunophenotypes. This common molecular mechanism of HLA-I alterations may reduce the ability of cytotoxic T lymphocytes  to kill tumor cells and negatively influence the clinical success of cancer immunotherapy.","1432-1211","Immunogenetics","(70) 647-659",2018,"María A","Garrido","MA","Servicio de Radiología, UGC de Radiología, Hospital Universitario Virgen de las Nieves, Granada, Spain."
30146063,"Validation of reference genes for real-time PCR of cord blood mononuclear cells, differentiating endothelial progenitor cells, and mature endothelial cells.","In the last ten years, endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) have gained interest as an attractive cell population in regenerative medicine for vascular applications. This population is defined as the precursor of endothelial mature cells (ECs) through a process of differentiation. To our knowledge, no single marker can be used to discriminate them from mature ECs. To effectively study their differentiation kinetics, gene expression must be assessed. Quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) is widely used to analyze gene expression. To minimize the impact of variances from RT-qPCR, a rigorous selection of reference genes must be performed prior to any experiments due to variations in experimental conditions. In this study, CD34+ mononuclear cells were extracted from human cord blood and differentiated into EPCs after seeding for a maximum period of 21 days. To choose the best combinations of reference genes, we compared the results of EPCs, CD34+ mononuclear cells, and mature endothelial cells to ensure that the differentiation kinetics did not affect the expression of our selected reference genes. The expression levels of seven genes, namely, YWHAZ, GAPDH, HPRT1, RPLP0, UBC, B2M, and TBP were thus compared. The algorithms geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, and the Comparative ΔCt method were employed to assess the expression of each candidate gene. Overall results reveal that the expression stability of reference genes may differ depending on the statistical program used. YWHAZ, GAPDH, and UBC composed the optimal set of reference genes for the gene expression studies performed by RT-qPCR in our experimental conditions. This work can thus serve as a starting point for the selection of candidate reference genes to normalize the levels of gene expression in endothelial progenitor cell populations.","1090-2422","Experimental cell research","(370) 389-398",2018,"Caroline","Royer","C","Univ.

30220970,"Quantitative screening of serum protein biomarkers by reverse phase protein arrays.","Screening biomarkers in serum samples for different diseases has always been of great interest because it presents an early, reliable, and, most importantly, noninvasive means of diagnosis and prognosis. Reverse phase protein arrays (RPPAs) are a high-throughput platform that can measure single or limited sets of proteins from thousands of patients' samples in parallel. They have been widely used for detection of signaling molecules involved in diseases, especially cancers, and related regulation pathways in cell lysates. However, this approach has been difficult to adapt to serum samples. Previously, we developed a sensitive method called the enhanced protein array to quantitatively measure serum protein levels from large numbers of patient samples. Here, we further refine the technology on several fronts: 1. simplifying the experimental procedure; 2. optimizing multiple parameters to make the assay more robust, including the support matrix, signal reporting method, background control, and antibody validation; and 3. establishing a method for more accurate quantification. Using this technology, we quantitatively measured the expression levels of 10 proteins: alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), beta 2 microglobulin (B2M), Carcinoma Antigen 15-3(CA15-3), Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), golgi protein 73 (GP73), Growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15), Human Epididymis Protein 4 (HE4), Insulin Like Growth Factor Binding Protein 2 (IGFBP2), osteopontin (OPN) and Beta-type platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFRB) from serum samples of 132 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients and 78 healthy volunteers. We found that 6 protein expression levels are significantly increased in HCC patients. Statistical and bioinformatical analysis has revealed decent accuracy rates of individual proteins, ranging from 0.617 (B2M) to 0.908 (AFP) as diagnostic biomarkers to distinguish HCC from healthy controls. The combination of these 6 proteins as a specific HCC signature yielded a higher accuracy of 0.923 using linear discriminant analysis (LDA), logistic regression (LR), random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM) predictive model analyses.

Quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) is commonly used to screen for differentially expressed genes and, for accurate results, proper reference housekeeping genes are essential. Here we assessed the mRNA expression of 18 well-known candidate reference genes at different parts of the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) of piglets during the weaning process by RT-qPCR assay. GeNorm analysis revealed that B2M/HMBS/HPRT1 were the three most stable reference genes and GAPDH was the least stable gene in the duodenum, jejunum, ileum, colon, and whole GIT. BestKeeper analysis found that B2M/HMBS/PGK11, HMBS/B2M/HPRT1, B2M/HMBS/HSPCB, B2M/HPRT1/HMBS, and B2M/HMBS/HPRT1 were the most stable genes in the duodenum, jejunum, ileum, colon, and whole GIT, respectively, whereas GAPDH, B-actin, and 18S rRNA were the least stable genes at different parts of the GIT. To confirm the crucial role of appropriate housekeeping genes in obtaining reliable results, we analyzed the expression of ALP using each of the 18 reference genes to normalize the RT-qPCR data. We found that the expression levels of ALP normalized using the most stable reference genes (B2M/HMBS/HPRT1) differed greatly from the expression levels obtained when the data were normalized using the least stable genes (GAPDH, B-actin, and 18S). We concluded that B2M/HMBS/HPRT1 were the optimal reference genes for gene expression analysis by RT-qPCR in the intestinal mucosal development stages of piglets at weaning.

To remove larger LMWPs and some protein-bound uremic toxins (PBUTs), high- and medium-cutoff (HCOs and MCOs, respectively) membranes, convective therapy and protein adsorptive membranes are available. When we use HCO or MCO membranes for convective therapy, we have to take care to avoid massive albumin leakage during a dialysis session. Convection volume is an important element to increase middle molecule removal; however, a larger convection volume has a risk of larger leakage of albumin. Predilution hemodiafiltration is a useful measurement to increase larger LMWPs without massive albumin leakage. β2-microglobulin (B2M), α1-microglobulin (A1M) and albumin leakage during a dialysis session are useful parameters for assessing middle-molecule removal. Reduction ratios of B2M >80% and of A1M >35% are favorable to improve severe dialysis-related symptoms. The efficacy of middle molecule removal should be evaluated in comparison with clinical outcomes, mortality, morbidity and the improvement of dialysis-related symptoms. Recently some dialysis-related symptoms such as sleep disturbance, skin itchiness and dialysis hypotension have been recognized as good surrogate makers for mortality. Further studies to evaluate the relationship between middle molecule or PBUTs removal and the improvement of patient symptoms should be performed in well-designed randomized controlled trials.","1460-2385","Nephrology, dialysis, transplantation : official publication of the European Dialysis and Transplant Association - European Renal Association","(33) iii12-iii21",2018,"Ikuto","Masakane","I","Department of Nephrology, Yabuki Hospital, Yamagata, Japan."

Biofilm challenged stimulated significant elevations compared to planktonic bacteria for IL32, IL8, CD44, B2M, TGFBI, NFKBIA, IL1B, CD59, IL1A, CCL20 representing the top 10 signals comprising 55% of the overall signal for the epithelial cell responses. Levels of PLAU, CD9, IFITM1, PLAUR, CD24, TNFSF10, and IL1RN were all elevated by each of the planktonic bacterial challenge vs the biofilm responses. While the biofilms up-regulated 123/579 genes (>2-fold), fewer genes were increased by the planktonic species (36 [S gordonii], 30 [F nucleatum], 44 [P gingivalis]). A wide array of immune genes were regulated by oral bacterial challenge of epithelial cells that would be linked to the local activity of innate and adaptive immune response components in the gingival tissues. Incorporating bacterial species into a structured biofilm dramatically altered the number and level of genes expressed. Additionally, a specific set of genes were significantly decreased with the multispecies biofilms suggesting that some epithelial cell biologic pathways are down-regulated when in contact with this type of pathogenic biofilm.","2041-1014","Molecular oral microbiology","10.1111/omi.12251",2019,"Jeffrey L","Ebersole","JL","Department of Biomedical Sciences, School of Dental Medicine, University of Nevada Las Vegas, Las Vegas, Nevada."
30467802,"Deciphering the transcriptome of prepubertal buffalo mammary glands using RNA sequencing.","Although water buffaloes are the main milk-producing animals in Indian subcontinent, only limited attempts have been made to identify canonical pathways and gene regulatory networks operating within the mammary glands of these animals. Such information is important for identifying unique transcriptome signatures in the mammary glands of diseased animals. In this report, we analyzed the transcription profile of 3 prepubertal buffalo mammary glands and identified common genes (mean FPKM > 0.2 in all samples) operating in the glands. Among 19,994 protein coding genes, 14,678 genes expressed and 5316 unique genes did not express in prepubertal buffalo mammary glands. Of these 14,678 expressed genes, 79% comprised a ubiquitous transcriptome that was dominated by very lowly expressed genes (51%). The percentage of rarely, moderately, and abundantly expressed genes was 25%, 2%, and 1%, respectively. Gene Ontology (GO) terms reflected in the expression of common genes (mean FPKM > 5.0) for molecular function were related to binding and catalytic activity. Products of these genes were involved in metabolic and cellular processes and belong to nucleic acid binding proteins. The canonical pathways for growth of mammary glands included integrin signaling, inflammation, GnRH and Wnt pathways. KEGG enriched pathways revealed many pathways of cancer including ribosome, splisosome, endocytosis, and ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, pathways for viral infection, and bacterial invasion of epithelial. Highly expressed genes (mean FPKM > 500 included beta-actin (ACTB), beta-2 microglobulin (B2M), caseins (CSN2, CNS3), collagens (COL1A1, COL3A1), translation elongation factors (EEF1A1, EEF1G, EEF2), keratins (KRT15, KRT19), major histocompatibility complex genes (CD74, JSP.1), vimentin (VIM), and osteopontin (SPP1). Interestingly, expression of milk protein genes in prepubertal glands opens possible roles of these genes in development of mammary glands. We report the whole transcriptomic signature of prepubertal buffalo mammary gland and indicated its molecular signature is similar to cancer type.","1438-7948","Functional & integrative genomics","(19) 349-362",2019,"Ratan K","Choudhary","RK","School of Animal Biotechnology, Guru Angad Dev Veterinary and Animal Sciences University, Ludhiana, Punjab, 141004, India.

30503610,"Immune checkpoint blockade resistance-related B2M hotspot mutations in microsatellite-unstable colorectal carcinoma.","β2-microglobulin (B2M), a component of major histocompatibility complex class I, plays an important role in host immune reaction to tumor, and inactivation of B2M is known to contribute to resistance to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) treatment. To further characterize the B2M alterations in tumors, we analyzed B2M hotspot mutations in 2765 benign and malignant tumor tissues by Sanger sequencing and found B2M mutations in 9 (7.5%) microsatellite-unstable (MSU) colorectal cancers (CRCs) and 3 leukemias (0.6-1.3%), but not in other tumors. Targeted sequencing panel analysis for MSU CRCs showed that B2M-mutated MSU CRCs harbored more driver mutations including TP53 than B2M-wild-type MSU CRCs. Of note, bi-allelic B2M alterations, which had been known to be accumulated during ICB treatment, were frequently found (3/9) in ICB treatment-naive CRCs. Clinicopathologic parameters including CD8 + T cell numbers, cancer stages and patients' survival, however, were not significantly different between B2M-mutated and B2M-wild-type MSU CRCs. Our results indicate that B2M mutation abundance is tissue type-specific (e.g., MSU CRCs) and that genetic makeup of B2M mutation might possibly shape the MSU CRC genomes even before the ICB therapies. Our results show that B2M mutation is common in MSU CRCs, which is one of the main targets for ICB treatment, suggesting that frequent B2M mutation status should be reminded for MSU CRCs in patient selection of ICB.","1618-0631","Pathology, research and practice","(215) 209-214",2019,"Su","Yeon Yeon","S","Departments of Pathology, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul 137-701, Republic of Korea; Departments of Cancer Evolution Research Center, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul 137-701, Republic of Korea."

Analyses using older/non-standardized definitions have shown low efficacy of B2M to predict acute kidney injury (AKI). We assessed if elevated levels of B2M would associate with either the diagnosis of AKI [under current Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) criteria] or recovery from AKI. We performed a retrospective study, including children who had urine B2M (uB2M) and/or serum B2M (sB2M) measured by immunoturbidimetry in our clinical laboratory between January 2011 and December 2015. We defined AKI based on KDIGO criteria [increase of serum creatinine (sCr) 0.3 mg/dL over 48 h or >50% baseline over 7 days] or urine output <0.5 mL/kg/h for 24 h. Recovery from AKI was defined as a return to baseline sCr within 6 months. We calculated receiver operating characteristics (ROC) area under the curve (AUC). Of 529 patients, 245 developed AKI. Serum and uB2M associated with AKI development (AUCs 0.84 and 0.73, respectively). Patients had a graded higher median sB2M and uB2M with each higher AKI stage. sB2M differentiated Stage I from Stage III AKI (P < 0.001) and Stage II from Stage III AKI (P = 0.004). However, neither uB2M nor sB2M levels associated with recovery from AKI. Only older age {hazard ratio [HR] 0.97, [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.94-0.99]} and need for dialysis [HR 0.39 (95% CI 0.23-0.61)] predicted incomplete recovery after AKI. Using KDIGO criteria, sB2M and uB2M associate with the severity of AKI. Given its relative ease and lower cost, we suggest more widespread use of B2M for AKI detection.","2048-8505","Clinical kidney journal","(11) 797-802",2018,"Kevin T","Barton","KT","Division of Pediatric Nephrology, Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO, USA."

Pharmaceutical regulatory agencies have qualified and issued letters of support for new biomarkers to better evaluate DIKI in nonclinical toxicity and clinical studies. Additional efforts have focused on drug-induced phospholipidosis (DIPL) and its potential link with collateral renal damage. The combined use of urinary biomarkers is an efficient way to evaluate renal safety in nonclinical and clinical studies. Eight FDA/EMA/PMDA qualified (or supported) urinary biomarkers, including kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1), β2-microglobulin (B2M), clusterin (CLU), cystatin C (CysC), trefoil factor 3 (TFF3), neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), osteopontin (OPN), and alpha-glutathione S-transferase (α-GST), were quantified by multiplex UPLC-MS/MS in a repeat dose study of gentamicin in rats. Rats administered gentamicin at 100 mg/kg/day for 2 weeks developed renal lesions detected by histopathology. Biomarkers of tubular damage (CLU, KIM-1, OPN) increased 9.8, 34.7, and 35.6-fold (relative to concurrent controls), respectively, after 2 weeks of dosing. Biomarkers of glomerular damage and/or impairment of tubular reabsorption (CysC, B2M) increased 11.7 and 22.6-fold. NGAL and α-GST increased <3-fold after 2 weeks of dosing. TFF3 was comparable to concurrent controls. The elevated biomarker concentrations met PSTC threshold criteria and were consistent with mechanisms of gentamicin nephrotoxicity. Increased urinary di-22:6-BMP indicated concomitant DIPL as confirmed by TEM. This work provides evidence supporting the combined use of the DIKI biomarker panel and di-22:6-BMP as a biomarker of DIPL in drug risk assessment.","1096-0333","Toxicology and applied pharmacology","(366) 54-63",2019,"Elizabeth","Tengstrand","E","Nextcea Inc., 500 West Cummings Park #4550, Woburn, MA 01801, USA."

Normalization to appropriate stably-expressed reference genes is essential for accurate quantitative measurement, but determination of such genes is challenging: healthy and dystrophic muscles present very different transcriptional environments, further altering with disease progression and muscle use, raising the possibility that no single gene or combination of genes may be stable under all experimental comparative scenarios. Despite the pedigree of this animal model, this problem remains unaddressed. The aim of this work was therefore to comprehensively assess reference gene suitability in the muscles of healthy and dystrophic mice, identifying reference genes appropriate for specific experimental comparisons, and determining whether an essentially universally-applicable set of genes exists. Using a large sample collection comprising multiple muscles (including the tibialis anterior, diaphragm and heart muscles) taken from healthy and mdx mice at three disease-relevant ages, and a panel of sixteen candidate reference genes (FBXO38, FBXW2, MON2, ZFP91, HTATSF1, GAPDH, ACTB, 18S, CDC40, SDHA, RPL13a, CSNK2A2, AP3D1, PAK1IP1, B2M and HPRT1), we used the geNorm, BestKeeper and Normfinder algorithms to identify genes that were stable under multiple possible comparative scenarios. We reveal that no single gene is stable under all conditions, but a normalization factor derived from multiple genes (RPL13a, CSNK2A2, AP3D1 and the widely-used ACTB) appears suitable for normalizing gene expression in both healthy and dystrophic mouse muscle regardless of muscle type or animal age. We further show that other popular reference genes, including GAPDH, are markedly disease- or muscle-type correlated. This study demonstrates the importance of empirical reference gene identification, and should serve as a valuable resource for investigators wishing to study gene expression in mdx mice.","1932-6203","PloS one","(14) e0211384",2019,"John C W","Hildyard","JCW","Department of Comparative Biomedical Sciences, Royal Veterinary College, London, United Kingdom."

B2M gene knockout and HLA-homozygous iPSC stocks can address this issue, but the former approach may induce NK cell activity and fail to present antigens, and it is challenging to recruit rare donors for the latter method. Here, we show two genome-editing strategies for making immunocompatible donor iPSCs. First, we generated HLA pseudo-homozygous iPSCs with allele-specific editing of HLA heterozygous iPSCs. Second, we generated HLA-C-retained iPSCs by disrupting both HLA-A and -B alleles to suppress the NK cell response while maintaining antigen presentation. HLA-C-retained iPSCs could evade T cells and NK cells in vitro and in vivo. We estimated that 12 lines of HLA-C-retained iPSCs combined with HLA-class II knockout are immunologically compatible with >90% of the world's population, greatly facilitating iPSC-based regenerative medicine applications.","1875-9777","Cell stem cell","(24) 566-578.e7",2019,"Huaigeng","Xu","H","Center for iPS Cell Research and Application (CiRA), Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan."

Metabolic and hormonal changes may be an informative but incomplete window into the underlying biology. We endeavored to identify objective blood gene expression biomarkers for psychological stress, a subjective sensation with biological roots. To quantify the stress perception at a particular moment in time, we used a simple visual analog scale for life stress in psychiatric patients, a high-risk group. Then, using a stepwise discovery, prioritization, validation, and testing in independent cohort design, we were successful in identifying gene expression biomarkers that were predictive of high-stress states and of future psychiatric hospitalizations related to stress, more so when personalized by gender and diagnosis. One of the top biomarkers that survived discovery, prioritization, validation, and testing was FKBP5, a well-known gene involved in stress response, which serves as a de facto reassuring positive control. We also compared our biomarker findings with telomere length (TL), another well-established biological marker of psychological stress and show that newly identified predictive biomarkers such as NUB1, APOL3, MAD1L1, or NKTR are comparable or better state or trait predictors of stress than TL or FKBP5. Over half of the top predictive biomarkers for stress also had prior evidence of involvement in suicide, and the majority of them had evidence in other psychiatric disorders, providing a molecular underpinning for the effects of stress in those disorders. Some of the biomarkers are targets of existing drugs, of potential utility in patient stratification, and pharmacogenomics approaches. Based on our studies and analyses, the biomarkers with the best overall convergent functional evidence (CFE) for involvement in stress were FKBP5, DDX6, B2M, LAIR1, RTN4, and NUB1. Moreover, the biomarker gene expression signatures yielded leads for possible new drug candidates and natural compounds upon bioinformatics drug repurposing analyses, such as calcium folinate and betulin. Our work may lead to improved diagnosis and treatment for stress disorders such as PTSD, that result in decreased quality of life and adverse outcomes, including addictions, violence, and suicide.","1476-5578","Molecular psychiatry","(25) 918-938",2020,"H","Le-Niculescu","H","Department of Psychiatry, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN, USA."

In the future, a combined use of functional and damage markers may advance the field of biomarkers of drug-induced kidney toxicity.

To gain an insight into key differences in oncogenic composition of exosomes, human non-malignant epithelial and pancreatic cancer cell models and purified and characterized resultant exosome populations are utilized. Proteomic analysis reveals the selective enrichment of known exosome markers and signaling proteins in comparison to parental cells. Importantly, valuable insights into oncogenic exosomes (362 unique proteins in comparison to non-malignant exosomes) of key metastatic regulatory factors and signaling molecules fundamental to pancreatic cancer progression (KRAS, CD44, EGFR) are provided. It is reported that oncogenic exosomes contain factors known to regulate the pre-metastatic niche (S100A4, F3, ITGβ5, ANXA1), clinically-relevant proteins which correlate with poor prognosis (CLDN1, MUC1) as well as protein networks involved in various cancer hallmarks including proliferation (CLU, CAV1), invasion (PODXL, ITGA3), metastasis (LAMP1, ST14) and immune surveillance escape (B2M). The presence of these factors in oncogenic exosomes offers an understanding of select differences in exosome composition during tumorigenesis, potential components as prognostic and diagnostic biomarkers in pancreatic cancer, and highlights the role of exosomes in mediating crosstalk between tumor and stromal cells.","1615-9861","Proteomics","(19) e1800158",2019,"Aikaterini","Emmanouilidi","A","Metabolic Signaling, School of Pharmacy and Biomedical Sciences, Curtin Health Innovation Research Institute, Curtin University, 6102, Perth, Western Australia, Australia."

Guide RNA-CAS9 methods were used to develop an isogenic IFITM1/IFITM3 double null cervical cancer model in order to define dominant pathways triggered by presence or absence of IFITM1/3 signalling. A pulse SILAC methodology identified IRF1, HLA-B, and ISG15 as the most dominating IFNγ inducible proteins whose synthesis was attenuated in the IFITM1/IFITM3 double-null cells. Conversely, SWATH-IP mass spectrometry of ectopically expressed SBP-tagged IFITM1 identified ISG15 and HLA-B as dominant co-associated proteins. ISG15ylation was attenuated in IFNγ treated IFITM1/IFITM3 double-null cells. Proximity ligation assays indicated that HLA-B can interact with IFITM1/3 proteins in parental SiHa cells. Cell surface expression of HLA-B was attenuated in IFNγ treated IFITM1/IFITM3 double-null cells. SWATH-MS proteomic screens in cells treated with IFITM1-targeted siRNA cells resulted in the attenuation of an interferon regulated protein subpopulation including MHC Class I molecules as well as IFITM3, STAT1, B2M, and ISG15. These data have implications for the function of IFITM1/3 in mediating IFNγ stimulated protein synthesis including ISG15ylation and MHC Class I production in cancer cells.

This study aimed to determine the incidence and patterns of extranodal (EN) and spleen disease using PET/CT, and assess their utility in predicting early clinical failure. PET/CT images from 613 cases of untreated FL (2003-2016) were reviewed. The location and number of EN sites, patterns of bone involvement, and splenic involvement were recorded. Outcomes were assessed using event-free survival (EFS), overall survival (OS), and early clinical failure at 24 months (EFS24). So, 49% (301/613) of patients had PET/CT-detected EN involvement, and 28% (171/613) had spleen involvement. The presence of ≥2 EN sites, spleen, bone or soft tissue involvement all predicted failure to achieve EFS24. Presence of ≥2 EN sites and bone involvement pattern were also predictive of OS in a univariate analysis. In a multivariate analysis with FLIPI-2 factors, spleen involvement, pattern of bone involvement, and soft tissue involvement independently predicted a lower EFS (HR 1.49 (1.11-2.00), P = .007; HR 1.71 (1.10-2.65), P = .017; and HR 1.67 (1.06-2.62), P = .026, respectively). When the multivariate analysis was performed using PRIMA-PI factors (marrow and B2M), the number of EN sites was an independent prognostic factor for inferior OS (HR 2.28; P = .05). Baseline PET/CT identifies EN involvement in nearly half of patients with untreated FL. The presence of ≥2 EN sites, bone, soft tissue, or splenic involvement predicts early clinical failure.

To study the molecular mechanism and identify crucial genes/pathways in pSS pathogenesis, the microarray-based whole-genome gene expression profiles from salivary glands of patients with pSS and non-sicca controls were retrieved. After normalization and subsequent batch effect adjustment, significance analysis of microarrays method was applied to five available datasets, and 379 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified. The 300 upregulated DEGs were enriched in Gene Ontology terms of immune and inflammatory responses, including antigen processing and presentation, interferon-mediated signaling pathway, and chemotaxis. Previously reported pSS-associated genes, including HLA-DRA, TAP2, PRDM1, and IFI16, were found to be significantly upregulated. The downregulated DEGs were enriched in pathways of salivary secretion, carbohydrate digestion and absorption, and starch and sucrose metabolism, implying dysfunction of salivary glands during pathogenesis.

31176987,"Whole transcriptome analysis of the Atlantic cod vaccine response reveals subtle changes in adaptive immunity.","Atlantic cod has lost the Major Histocompatibility complex class II pathway - central to pathogen presentation, humoral response and immunity. Here, we investigate the immunological response of Atlantic cod subsequent to dip vaccination with Vibrioanguillarum bacterin using transcriptome sequencing. The experiment was conducted on siblings from an Atlantic cod family found to be highly susceptible towards vibriosis where vaccination has demonstrated improved pathogen resistance. Gene expression analyses at 2, 4, 21 and 42 days post vaccination revealed GO-term enrichment for muscle, neuron and metabolism-related pathways. In-depth characterization of immune-related GO terms demonstrated down-regulation of MHCI antigen presentation, C-type lectin receptor signaling and granulocyte activation over time. Phagocytosis, interferon-gamma signaling and negative regulation of innate immunity were increasingly up-regulated over time. Individual differentially expressed immune genes implies weak initiation of acute phase proteins with little or no inflammation. Furthermore, gene expression indicates presence of T-cells, NK-like cells, B-cells and monocytes/macrophages. Three MHCI transcripts were up-regulated with B2M and SEC61. Overall, we find no clear immune-related transcriptomic response which could be attributed to Atlantic cod's alternative immune system. However, we cannot rule out that this response is related to vaccination protocol/sampling strategy. Earlier functional studies demonstrate significant memory in Atlantic cod post dip vaccination and combined with our results indicate the presence of other adaptive immunity mechanisms. In particular, we suggest that further investigations should look into CD8+ memory T-cells, γδ T-cells, T-cell independent memory or memory induced through NK-like/other lymphoid cells locally in the mucosal lining for this particular vaccination strategy.","1878-0407","Comparative biochemistry and physiology.

Here we intend to describe clinical characteristics, rates of response, survival and second neoplasms in HCL patients treated in a reference center in Brazil. All patients diagnosed with HCL between July/1987 and Jun/2018 were included in this analysis. Fifty-four patients were included in this analysis. Median age at diagnosis was 55 years (range, 26-88), with 37% being above 60 years-old. Most patients were treated with cladribine in our cohort (n = 36; 68%), administered through intravenous continuous infusion. Remaining patients were firstly managed with splenectomy (n = 7; 13%), IFN (n = 6; 11%) and rituximab (n = 2; 4%). In a univariate analysis, platelet count and B2M level at diagnosis were statistically associated with CR achievement (p = 0.004 and p = 0.024, respectively). A median follow-up time of 9 years was calculated. Estimated 10-year overall survival was 91.1% (95% confidence interval, 77-97). In this cohort, 10 patients had any second neoplasm, diagnosed before or after HCL. Regarding the sites of cancer, 69% were of skin - 8/16 carcinoma-type and 3/16 melanoma-type. Our response and survival data are similar to those reported by literature, which reaffirms the role of purine analogs in current HCL management. With a very long follow-up we also have observed a high incidence of second neoplasm.","1873-5835","Leukemia research","(83) 106165",2019,"Wellington F","da Silva","WF","Institute of Cancer of São Paulo (ICESP), University of São Paulo, Av.

31203147,"Immune-related somatic mutation genes are enriched in PDACs with diabetes.","The bidirectional interaction between pancreatic cancer (PanCa) and diabetes has been confirmed by epidemiological studies, but until now, the underlying molecular mechanisms for this connection is not fully understood yet. Here, we analyzed the clinical and genomic data of 26 pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) patients without diabetes, and six diabetic PDAC patients, whose tumors underwent targeted next-generation sequencing (551 cancer-related genes included). Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) was performed to investigate genetic alterations and biological consequences associated with PDACs with or without diabetes. We identified 345 somatic mutations of 153 genes in test cohort and a positive association between diabetes duration and somatic mutation burden. KRAS, TP53, and SMAD4 were the top3 commonly mutated genes at a similar frequency compared to the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data. Several novel but infrequent mutations in other genes (MDC1, PRB2, and PRB4) were also found. Besides, 13 mutated genes (PIK3CD, SNCAIP, IRF4, HLA-A, NOTCH4, PIM1, ETV6, B2M, CD70, PRDM14, TGFBR1, FLT1, and PARP2) were uniquely found in the diabetic group, mainly involved in immune-related pathways. Further targeted sequencing of these genes in an independent validation cohort (n = 50) revealed significant enrichment in the diabetic group (n = 18, P = 2.6964E-08). Long-standing diabetes (≥3-year duration) may induce increasing somatic mutations with time, facilitating tumor initiation. Gene mutants associated with immune-related pathways could be used to distinguish the diabetic PDAC patients from the non-diabetic cases and allow more selective treatment.","1936-5233","Translational oncology","(12) 1147-1154",2019,"Kaixuan","Wang","K","Department of Gastroenterology, Changhai Hospital, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, China.

31253869,"Determinants of immunological evasion and immunocheckpoint inhibition response in non-small cell lung cancer: the genetic front.","The incorporation into clinical practice of immune-checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), such as those targeting the cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) and the programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) and its ligand (PD-L1), has represented a major breakthrough in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treatment, especially in cases where the cancer has no druggable genetic alterations. Despite becoming the standard of care in certain clinical settings, either alone or in combination with chemotherapy, a proportion of patients do not respond while others actually progress during treatment. Therefore, there is a clinical need to identify accurate predictive biomarkers and to develop novel therapeutic strategies based on ICIs. Although they have limitations, the current markers evaluated to select which patients will undergo ICI treatment are the levels of PD-L1 and the tumor mutational burden. In this paper we describe what is currently known about the dynamic interaction between the cancer cell and the immune system during carcinogenesis, with a particular focus on the description of the functions and gene alterations that preclude the host immunoresponse in NSCLC. We emphasize the deleterious gene alterations in components of the major histocompatibility complex (HLA-I or B2M) and of the response to IFNγ (such as JAK2) which are mutually exclusive and can affect up to one fifth of the NSCLCs. The participation of other gene alterations, such as those of common oncogenes and tumor suppressors, and of the epigenetic alterations will also be discussed, in detail. Finally, we discuss the potential use of the tumor's genetic profile to predict sensitivity to ICIs.","1476-5594","Oncogene","(38) 5921-5932",2019,"Maria","Saigi","M","Genes and Cancer Group, Cancer Epigenetics and Biology Program (PEBC), Bellvitge Biomedical Research Institute (IDIBELL), Hospitalet de Llobregat, Barcelona, Spain."
31286408,"Selection of Reference Genes for Normalization of Gene Expression Data in Blood of Machado-Joseph Disease/Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 3 (MJD/SCA3) Subjects.","Alongside with the emergent clinical trials for Machado-Joseph disease/Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (MJD/SCA3) comes the need to identify molecular biomarkers of disease that can be tracked throughout the trial. MJD is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder caused by expansion of a CAG repeat in the coding region of the ATXN3 gene. Previous findings indicate the potential of transcriptional alterations in blood of MJD patients as biomarkers of disease. Accurate quantification of gene expression levels by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) depends on data normalization, usually performed using reference genes. Because the expression level of routinely used housekeeping genes may vary in multiple biological and experimental conditions, reference gene controls should be validated in each specific experimental design. Here, we aimed to evaluate the expression behavior of five housekeeping genes previously reported as stably expressed in peripheral blood of patients from several disorders-peptidylprolyl isomerase B (PPIB), TNF receptor associated protein 1 (TRAP1), beta-2-microglobulin (B2M), 2,4-dienoyl-CoA reductase 1 (DECR1), and folylpolyglutamate synthase (FPGS). Expression levels of these five genes were assessed by qPCR in blood from MJD subjects (preataxic and patients) and matched controls. While all housekeeping genes, here studied, were stably expressed in our sets of samples, TRAP1 showed to be the most stable gene by NormFinder and BestKeeper. We, therefore, conclude that any of these genes could be used as reference gene in future qPCR studies using blood samples from MJD subjects.","1559-1166","Journal of molecular neuroscience : MN","(69) 450-455",2019,"Ana F","Ferreira","AF","Faculdade de Ciências e Tecnologia, Universidade dos Açores, Ponta Delgada, Portugal. ana.fb.ferreira@uac.pt."

The specific objectives of this work were to evaluate if vv+MDV immunosuppression (MDV-IS) is induced by reduction of lymphocyte responsiveness and/or viability. Three experiments were conducted to (i) compare vv+MDV 686 with a partially attenuated 686-BAC; (ii) compare vv+MDV strains (648A and 686) with vMDV (GA) and vvMDV (Md5); and (iii) compare chickens vaccinated with Md5-BACΔMEQ and with CVI988 + HVT. In each experiment, spleens were collected at 28-30 days post infection and lymphocytes were isolated and investigated in three ways: their proliferative response to Concanavalin A (ConA) was analysed by MTT proliferation assay; cell death, and expression of CD45 and MHC-I was studied by flow cytometry; and MHC-IA and β-2 microglobulin (B2M) expression was evaluated by real time RT-PCR. Splenocytes of chickens inoculated with vv+MDV were severely impaired to proliferate when exposed to ConA. Furthermore, vv+MDV induced severe splenocyte death that did not occur after infection with v or vvMDV strains. Vaccination with CVI988 + HVT, and at less level with Md5-BACΔMEQ reduced these negative effects. This is in contrast to our previous results in which Md5-BACΔMEQ but not CVI988 + HVT protected against MDV-IS suggesting that although cell death and decrease lymphocyte function seem to be related to MDV virulence and certainly will be associated with immunosuppression, they might not fully explain the previously reported MDV-IS.

HLA mutations have been implicated as a mechanism of immune evasion during tumorigenesis, and B2M is considered a tumor suppressor gene. However, the implications of somatic HLA and B2M mutations have not been fully explored in the context of antigen presentation via the MHC-I molecule during tumor development.

31421890,"Genetic mechanisms regulating the host response during mastitis.","Mastitis is a very costly and common disease in the dairy industry. The study of the transcriptome from healthy and mastitic milk somatic cell samples using RNA-Sequencing technology can provide measurements of transcript levels associated with the immune response to the infection. The objective of this study was to characterize the Holstein milk somatic cell transcriptome from 6 cows to determine host response to intramammary infections. RNA-Sequencing was performed on 2 samples from each cow from 2 separate quarters, one classified as healthy (n = 6) and one as mastitic (n = 6). In total, 449 genes were differentially expressed between the healthy and mastitic quarters (false discovery rate <0.05, fold change >±2). Among the differentially expressed genes, the most expressed genes based on reads per kilobase per million mapped reads (RPKM) in the healthy group were associated with milk components (CSN2 and CSN3), and in the mastitic group they were associated with immunity (B2M and CD74). In silico functional analysis was performed using the list of 449 differentially expressed genes, which identified 36 significantly enriched metabolic pathways (false discovery rate <0.01), some of which were associated with the immune system, such as cytokine-cytokine interaction and cell adhesion molecules. Seven functional candidate genes were selected, based on the criteria of being highly differentially expressed between healthy and mastitic groups and significantly enriched in metabolic pathways that are relevant to the inflammatory process (GLYCAM1, B2M, CD74, BoLA-DRA, FCER1G, SDS, and NFKBIA). Last, we identified the differentially expressed genes that are located in quantitative trait locus regions previously known to be associated with mastitis, specifically clinical mastitis, somatic cell count, and somatic cell score. It was concluded that multiple genes within quantitative trait locus regions could potentially affect host response to mastitis-causing agents, making some cows more susceptible to intramammary infections. The identification of potential candidate genes with functional, statistical, biological, and positional relevance associated with host defense to infection will contribute to a better understanding of the underlying genetic architecture associated with mastitis. This in turn will improve the sustainability of agricultural practices by facilitating the selection of cows with improved host defense leading to increased resistance to mastitis.","1525-3198","Journal of dairy science","(102) 9043-9059",2019,"V","Asselstine","V","Centre for Genetic Improvement of Livestock, Department of Animal Biosciences, University of Guelph, Guelph, Ontario, Canada, N1G 2W1."

The purpose of the present study was to investigate the clinical significance of enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) and histone deacetylase 1 and 2 (HDAC1/2) expression in PTCL. A total of 82 patients were enrolled in the present study, including 43 with PTCL not otherwise specified (PTCL-NOS), 10 with angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL), 14 with natural killer/T-cell lymphoma (NK/TCL) and 15 with anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL). EZH2 and HDAC1/2 expression was detected by immunohistochemistry and any correlations between them were evaluated. Additionally, any correlations between EZH2 or HDAC1/2 expression and a number of clinicopathological characteristics were analyzed, and survival curves were created. Results revealed that 55.8% of patients with PTCL-NOS, 57.1% of patients with NK/TCL, 86.7% of patients ALCL and 50% of patients with AITL highly expressed HDAC1. Furthermore, 58.1% of patients with PTCL-NOS, 57.1% of patients with NK/TCL, 53.3% of patients with ALCL and 60% of patients with AITL highly expressed HDAC2. Additionally, 67.5% of patients with PTCL-NOS, 50% of patients with NK/TCL, 73.3% of patients with ALCL and 60% of patients with AITL highly expressed EZH2. EZH2 expression was significantly correlated with the presence of B symptoms, elevated LDH and elevated β2 microglobulin (B2M; P<0.05), and HDAC2 expression was significantly correlated with sex, advanced clinical stages, high international prognostic index scores and elevated B2M levels (P<0.05) in all the patients with PTCL. However, different subtypes of PTCL are correlated with different clinical characteristics. Patients with PTCL highly expressing EZH2 or HDAC2 exhibit a poorer overall survival rate. In conclusion, EZH2 and HDAC1/2 were frequently upregulated in patients with PTCL, and the patients with a higher EZH2 and HDAC2 expression usually exhibited a poorer survival rate. Therefore, EZH2 and HDAC2 may be prognostic markers in patients with PTCL, particularly in those with PTCL-NOS.","1792-1074","Oncology letters","(18) 1415-1423",2019,"Huilai","Zhang","H","Department of Lymphoma, Sino-US Center for Lymphoma and Leukemia, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, National Clinical Research Center of Cancer, Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Therapy, Tianjin 300060, P.R.

Results from optical measurements were compared with the results from chemical laboratory. Ten chronic dialysis patients, mean age 59 ± 15 years, were included in the study during 40 hemodialysis sessions. Low-flux hemodialysis (HD), high-flux hemodialysis (HF), and postdilutional online hemodiafiltration (HDF) with different settings were used. The reduction ratio (RR) and total removed solute (TRS) of three uremic solutes were determined: small molecular weight urea, middle molecular β2-microglobulin (B2M), and protein-bound indoxyl sulfate (IS). Concentrations of these solutes in the spent dialysate were measured by laboratory (lab) and optical (opt) methods, in the serum by laboratory methods, and calculated RR values in percentage were compared accordingly. Total removed solute was obtained from the total dialysate collection (TDC) using lab and opt methods. The highest RR values were found for urea and B2M, and the lowest for IS. The difference between RR of lab and opt results estimated as mean accuracy (BIAS) was ≤8.1% for all three solutes. Good correspondence between TRS lab vs. opt was achieved, resulting in strong linear correlation values R from 0.727 for urea to 0.971 for IS. Accuracy for TRS values as BIAS ± standard error (SE), comparing lab vs. opt, showed no statistical difference for any of the observed uremic solutes (P > 0.05).

Magnesium sulfate (Mg) showed a kidney-protective effect against cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity (CIN) by regulating renal platinum accumulation both in vitro and in vivo, and the body of clinical data demonstrating the efficacy of this drug in adult cancer patients is increasing.In this open, multicenter, phase-2, randomized trial, patients under age 18 years who are scheduled to receive cisplatin-containing chemotherapy will be enrolled and randomly allocated either to an Mg supplementation arm in even-numbered chemotherapy courses (arm AB) or to another arm in odd-numbered courses (arm BA), with a 1:1 allocation. Analysis objects will be reconstructed into two groups depending on whether the chemotherapy course has Mg supplementation (group B) or not (group A). The primary endpoint is the proportion of chemotherapy courses resulting in elevated serum creatinine equal to or greater than 50% of the prechemotherapy value. For the secondary endpoints, various parameters for measuring kidney function, such as serum cystatin-C, B2M, L-FABP, NGAL, and urinary NAG in the two groups will be compared. A sample size based on alpha = 5% and 80% power requires at least 40 samples per group (ideally, 60 samples per group).If Mg demonstrates efficacy, a phase-3 study to confirm the prophylactic effect of Mg supplementation in both acute and chronic CIN will be developed using novel and better biomarkers.","2451-8654","Contemporary clinical trials communications","(16) 100440",2019,"Atsushi","Makimoto","A","Department of Hematology / Oncology, Tokyo Metropolitan Children's Medical Center, 2-8-29, Musashidai, Fuchu-shi, Tokyo, 183-8561, Japan."
31560972,"Mycophenolic acid (MPA) modulates host cellular autophagy progression in sub genomic dengue virus-2 replicon cells.","Cellular autophagy (Macrophagy) is a self-degradative process, executed through the network of autophagy associated genes (ATGs) encoded proteins. Both in vitro and in vivo studies suggest that dengue virus (DENV) induces autophagy and supports the viral genome replication and translation. Therefore, the cellular autophagy induced by dengue virus can be a good target for antiviral drug development. The action of mycophenolic acid (MPA), a specific inhibitor of DENV replication, was investigated in the stable BHK-21/DENV2 replicon cells. The inhibition was mediated by enhanced degradation of autophagic substrates in stable BHK-21/DENV2 replicon cells as evidenced by a decrease in lapidated LC3 (LC3II) and p62 expression in the presence of MPA. In contrast, the results indicated that four gene sets, namely Transmembrane protein 74 (TMEM74), Unc-51-like kinase 2 (ULK2), Cathepsin D (CTSD) and Estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1) were upregulated in stable BHK-21/DENV2 replicon cells, due to the sustained dynamic replication of DENV2 genome. These ATGs involved in the pre-autophagosomal structure (PAS) formation, were suppressed in the presence MPA. Instead, MPA induced the expression of different set of autophagy genes such as ATG4, AKT1, APP, ATG16L1, ATG16L2, B2M and HPRT1. An enzyme involved in the nucleotide salvage pathway, HPRT1, was highly expressed in the presence of MPA. The study shows that DENV2 replication is dependent on PAS formation and is inhibited in the presence of MPA by enhancing the degradation of autophagic substrates and suppression of PAS formation. This study provides impetus in designing MPA analogues to effectively inhibit dengue viral replication.","1096-1208","Microbial pathogenesis","(137) 103762",2019,"Nageswar Reddy","Manchala","NR","Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, School of Biological Sciences, Central University of Kerala, Tejaswini Hills, Periye, 671320, Kerala, India."

We present for the first time the expression pattern of AR-FL, AR-V7, and AR-567es at a quantitative level in circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and paired plasma-derived extracellular vesicles in mCRPC. We first developed and analytically validated a novel multiplex RT-qPCR assay for AR full length (AR-FL), AR-V7, AR-567es and AR-total. We then quantified the expression levels of AR-splice variants, CK-19 (epithelial marker) and B2M (reference gene) in EpCAM+ CTCs, and paired plasma-derived extracellular vesicles isolated from peripheral blood (20 mL) of 62 mCRPC patients and 10 healthy donors. CTCs were enumerated using the FDA-cleared CellSearch® system. In CTCs AR-FL was detected in 64/69 (92.3%), AR-V7 in 34/69 (49.3%), AR-567es in 16/69 (23.2%) and AR-total in 62/69 (89.9%).

31597848,"[The immune microenvironment in malignant lymphoma].","Recent advances in immunotherapy have highlighted the importance of the tumor microenvironment. Lymphomas are a heterogeneous group of malignancies that arise from lymphocytes and typically develop in lymphoid tissues. It has been recognized that the elements of the lymphoma microenvironment are not mere bystanders to a host antitumor inflammatory response but are important components of the tumor that support proliferation, survival, and chemoresistance of lymphoma cells. Lymphoma cells have individual expression patterns of chemokine receptors and adhesion molecules, according to their histological subtypes, and the patterns of surface molecules determine the sites of tumor involvement. Lymphoma cells often depend on the signals provided by non-tumor cells, such as stromal cells and macrophages, through direct cell contact and paracrine factors. On the other hand, there are genetic and non-genetic mechanisms allowing lymphoma cells to escape from anti-tumor immunity, such as downregulation of HLA molecules, B2M, CD58, CD70, and/or upregulation of PD-L1 and PD-L2. Further understanding of the interactions of lymphoma cells and the tumor microenvironment gives an insight into the pathogenesis of lymphomas and supports new approaches to their treatment.","0485-1439","[Rinsho ketsueki] The Japanese journal of clinical hematology","(60) 1229-1235",2019,"Momoko","Nishikori","M","Department of Hematology and Oncology, Kyoto University, Graduate School of Medicine."
31600176,"TFEB Expression Profiling in Renal Cell Carcinomas: Clinicopathologic Correlations.","TFEB is overexpressed in TFEB-rearranged renal cell carcinomas as well as in renal tumors with amplifications of TFEB at 6p21.1. As recent literature suggests that renal tumors with 6p21.1 amplification behave more aggressively than those with rearrangements of TFEB, we compared relative TFEB gene expression in these tumors. This study included 37 TFEB-altered tumors: 15 6p21.1-amplified and 22 TFEB-rearranged (including 5 cases from The Cancer Genome Atlas data set). TFEB status was verified using a combination of fluorescent in situ hybridization (n=27) or comprehensive molecular profiling (n=13) and digital droplet polymerase chain reaction was used to quantify TFEB mRNA expression in 6p21.1-amplified (n=9) and TFEB-rearranged renal tumors (n=19). These results were correlated with TFEB immunohistochemistry. TFEB-altered tumors had higher TFEB expression when normalized to B2M (mean: 168.9%, n=28), compared with non-TFEB-altered controls (mean: 7%, n=18, P=0.005). Interestingly, TFEB expression in tumors with rearrangements (mean: 224.7%, n=19) was higher compared with 6p21.1-amplified tumors (mean: 51.2%, n=9; P=0.06). Of note, classic biphasic morphology was only seen in TFEB-rearranged tumors and when present correlated with 6.8-fold higher TFEB expression (P=0.00004). Our results suggest that 6p21.1 amplified renal tumors show increased TFEB gene expression but not as much as t(6;11) renal tumors. These findings correlate with the less consistent/diffuse expression of downstream markers of TFEB activation (cathepsin K, melan A, HMB45) seen in the amplified neoplasms. This suggests that the aggressive biological behavior of 6p21.1 amplified renal tumors might be secondary to other genes at the 6p21.1 locus that are co-amplified, such as VEGFA and CCND3, or other genetic alterations.","1532-0979","The American journal of surgical pathology","(43) 1445-1461",2019,"Sounak","Gupta","S","Departments of Pathology."
31645594,"Validation of Reference Genes for Normalization of Relative qRT-PCR Studies in Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma.","Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) in thyroid tumors require accurate data normalization, however, there are no sufficient studies addressing the suitable reference genes for gene expression analysis in malignant and normal thyroid tissue specimens. The purpose of this study was to identify valid internal control genes for normalization of relative qRT-PCR studies in human papillary thyroid carcinoma tissue samples. The expression characteristics of 12 candidate reference genes (GAPDH, ACTB, HPRT1, TBP, B2M, PPIA, 18SrRNA, HMBS, GUSB, PGK1, RPLP0, and PGM1) were assessed by qRT-PCR in 45 thyroid tissue samples (15 papillary thyroid carcinoma, 15 paired normal tissues and 15 multinodular goiters). These twelve candidate reference genes were selected by a systematic literature search. GeNorm, NormFinder, and BestKeeper statistical algorithms were applied to determine the most stable reference genes. The three algorithms were in agreement in identifying GUSB and HPRT1 as the most stably expressed genes in all thyroid tumors investigated. According to the NormFinder software, the pair of genes including 'GUSB and HPRT1' or 'GUSB and HMBS' or 'GUSB and PGM1' were the best combinations for selection of pair reference genes. The optimal number of genes required for reliable normalization of qPCR data in thyroid tissues would be three according to calculations made by GeNorm algorithm. These results suggest that GUSB and HPRT1 are promising reference genes for normalization of relative qRT-PCR studies in papillary thyroid carcinoma.","2045-2322","Scientific reports","(9) 15241",2019,"S Adeleh","Razavi","SA","Cellular and Molecular Endocrine Research Center, Research Institute for Endocrine Sciences, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."

Sixty-six patients with chronic back pain secondary to osteoarthritis were randomly enrolled and treated with daily mud packs and bicarbonate-alkaline mineral water baths, or a thermal hydrotherapy rehabilitation scheme, the combination of the two regimens or usual medication only (control group), for two weeks. Clinical variables were evaluated at baseline, after 2 and 12 weeks. One thousand serum proteins were tested before and after a two-week mud bath therapy. All spa treatment groups showed clinical benefit as determined by improvements in VAS pain, Roland Morris disability questionnaire and neck disability index at both time points. The following serum proteins were found greatly increased (≥2.5 fold) after spa treatment: inhibin beta A subunit (INHBA), activin A receptor type 2B (ACVR2B), angiopoietin-1 (ANGPT1), beta-2-microglobulin (B2M), growth differentiation factor 10 (GDF10), C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 5 (CXCL5), fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2), fibroblast growth factor 12 (FGF12), oxidized low density lipoprotein receptor 1 (OLR1), matrix metallopeptidase 13 (MMP13). Three proteins were found greatly decreased (≤0.65 fold): apolipoprotein C-III (Apoc3), interleukin 23 alpha subunit p19 (IL23A) and syndecan-1 (SDC1). Spa therapy was confirmed as beneficial for chronic back pain and proved to induce changes in proteins involved in functions such as gene expression modulation, differentiation, angiogenesis, tissue repair, acute and chronic inflammatory response.","0048-7449","Reumatismo","(71) 119-131",2019,"M M","Angioni","MM","Dipartimento di Scienze Mediche e Sanità Pubblica, Università degli Studi di Cagliari, Monserrato (CA). m.maddalena.angioni@gmail.com."

PMBLs share clinical, transcriptional, and molecular features with classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL), including constitutive activation of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), JAK/STAT signaling, and programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1)-mediated immune evasion. The demonstrated efficacy of PD-1 blockade in relapsed/refractory PMBLs led to recent approval by the US Food and Drug Administration and underscored the importance of characterizing targetable genetic vulnerabilities in this disease. Here, we report a comprehensive analysis of recurrent genetic alterations -somatic mutations, somatic copy number alterations, and structural variants-in a cohort of 37 newly diagnosed PMBLs. We identified a median of 9 genetic drivers per PMBL, including known and newly identified components of the JAK/STAT and NF-κB signaling pathways and frequent B2M alterations that limit major histocompatibility complex class I expression, as in cHL. PMBL also exhibited frequent, newly identified driver mutations in ZNF217 and an additional epigenetic modifier, EZH2. The majority of these alterations were clonal, which supports their role as early drivers. In PMBL, we identified several previously uncharacterized molecular features that may increase sensitivity to PD-1 blockade, including high tumor mutational burden, microsatellite instability, and an apolipoprotein B mRNA editing catalytic polypeptide-like (APOBEC) mutational signature. The shared genetic features between PMBL and cHL provide a framework for analyzing the mechanism of action of PD-1 blockade in these related lymphoid malignancies.","1528-0020","Blood","(134) 2369-2382",2019,"Bjoern","Chapuy","B","Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA."

In spite of the efforts to clarify the relationship among genetic factors and susceptibility to develop OP, many genetic associations need to be further functionally validated. Besides, some limitations as the choice of stably expressed reference genes (RG) should be overcome to ensure the quality and reproducibility of gene expression assays. To our knowledge, a validation study for RG in OP is still missing. We compared the expression levels, using polymerase chain reaction quantitative real time (qPCR) of 10 RG (G6PD, B2M, GUSB, HSP90, EF1A, RPLP0, GAPDH, ACTB, 18 S and HPRT1) to assess their suitability in OP analysis by using GeNorm, Normfinder, BestKeeper and RefFinder programs. A minimal number of two RG was recommended by GeNorm to obtain a reliable normalization. RPLP0 and B2M were identified as the most stable genes in OP studies while ACTB, 18 S and HPRT1 were inadequate for normalization in our data set. Moreover, we showed the dramatic effects of suboptimal RG choice on the quantification of a target gene, highlighting the importance in the identification of the most appropriate reference gene to specific diseases. We suggest the use of RPLP0 and B2M as the most stable reference genes while we do not recommend the use of the least stable reference genes HPRT1, 18 S and ACTB in OP expression assays using PBMC as biological source.

However, diagnostic tests are lacking for many of these, including warthogs (Phacochoerus africanus). Most literature on suids has focused on using serological tools, with few studies investigating the use of cell-mediated immune response (CMI) assays. A recent study showed that warthogs develop measurable CMI responses, which suggests that cytokine gene expression assays (GEAs) may be valuable for detecting M. bovis-infection, as shown in numerous African wildlife species. Therefore, the aim of the study was to develop GEAs capable of distinguishing between M. bovis-infected and uninfected warthogs. Whole blood was stimulated using the QuantiFERON-TB Gold (In-Tube) system, using ESAT-6 and CFP-10 peptides, before determining the relative gene expression of five reference (B2M, H3F3A, LDHA, PPIA and YWHAZ) and five target (CXCL9, CXCL10, CXCL11, IFNG and TNFA) genes through qPCR. The reference gene H3F3A was the most stably expressed, while all target genes were significantly upregulated in M. bovis-infected warthogs with the greatest upregulation observed for CXCL10.

One mechanism by which gliomas and other cancers can hamper CAR T cells is through surface expression of inhibitory ligands such as programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1). Using the CRIPSR-Cas9 system, we created universal CAR T cells resistant to PD-1 inhibition through multiplexed gene disruption of endogenous T-cell receptor (TRAC), beta-2 microglobulin (B2M) and PD-1 (PDCD1). Triple gene-edited CAR T cells demonstrated enhanced activity in preclinical glioma models. Prolonged survival in mice bearing intracranial tumors was achieved after intracerebral, but not intravenous administration.

A clearance-based equation that utilized predialysis and postdialysis B2M measurements, patient weight, treatment duration and ultrafiltration had higher discrimination than an equation previously derived in humans.

HRS cells exhibit near-universal somatic copy gains of chromosome 9p/9p24.1, which increase expression of the programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) ligands. To define genetic mechanisms of response and resistance to PD-1 blockade and identify complementary treatment targets, we performed whole-exome sequencing of flow cytometry-sorted HRS cells from 23 excisional biopsies of newly diagnosed cHLs, including 8 Epstein-Barr virus-positive (EBV+) tumors. We identified significantly mutated cancer candidate genes (CCGs) as well as somatic copy number alterations and structural variations and characterized their contribution to disease-defining immune evasion mechanisms and nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), JAK/STAT, and PI3K signaling pathways. EBV- cHLs had a higher prevalence of genetic alterations in the NF-κB and major histocompatibility complex class I antigen presentation pathways. In this young cHL cohort (median age, 26 years), we identified a predominant mutational signature of spontaneous deamination of cytosine- phosphate-guanines (""Aging""), in addition to apolipoprotein B mRNA editing catalytic polypeptide-like, activation-induced cytidine deaminase, and microsatellite instability (MSI)-associated hypermutation. In particular, the mutational burden in EBV- cHLs was among the highest reported, similar to that of carcinogen-induced tumors. Together, the overall high mutational burden, MSI-associated hypermutation, and newly identified genetic alterations represent additional potential bases for the efficacy of PD-1 blockade in cHL.

In our study, 37 MSI-H and 5 MSI-L patients were selected for screening of B2M mutational and methylation status. The characterization of patients was based on standard histopathological diagnosis and TNM classification; BRAF, KRAS mutations, tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and peritumoral lymphoid reaction were also determined. MSI analysis was performed using fragment analysis. B2M mutations were identified by Sanger sequencing, and methylation of CpG islands in promoter region was detected by methylation-specific PCR. Heterozygous mutations in the B2M gene were detected in five MSI-H patients (13.5%), while the mutation c.45_48delTTCT was determined in four patients and mutation c.276delC was found in two patients. One of these five patients was compound heterozygote harboring both mutations. Methylation of the promoter region of the B2M gene was observed in one patient with MSI-H colorectal cancer.

The correlations between renal function parameters and chemical exposure (either independently or interactively) were explored by linear regression models. To simplify the analysis, phthalate metabolites were dimensionally reduced using principal component analysis (PCA) method. [Result] Urinary melamine was positively associated with renal function parameters of both albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) and β2-microglobulin (B2M) in multivariate linear regression models (P < 0.05). A PCA pattern characterized by high-molecular-weight phthalates (HMWP) was positively associated with all three parameters of renal function (ACR, B2M, and N-acetyl-β-d-glucosaminidase (NAG)).

In this study, we selected eight candidate reference genes (18S, Actin, EF-1α, 40S, B2M, TUBA, UBCE and GAPDH) basing on transcriptome analysis and the traditional housekeeping genes, and analyzed the stability of the reference genes in spleen, head kidney and head kidney leukocytes (HKL) after pathogen challenge in Schizothorax prenanti (S. prenanti). Three common programs (geNorm, NormFinder and Bestkeeper) were used to evaluate the stability of the candidate reference genes. Two reference genes, Actin and EF-1α presented higher stability, while 18S and GAPDH were the lower stable genes, both in in vitro and in vivo. An important immune gene, toll-like receptor 22a (TLR22a), was selected to validate the stability of the proposed reference genes (Actin and EF-1α) across different experiment treatments. The results reveal that Actin and EF-1α are quite suitable reference genes for the normalization analysis. Otherwise, using the most stable gene Actin to validate the reliable of transcriptome data showed the high correlation between the fold change of transcriptome data and qRT-PCR data.

31951029,"Estimation of residual renal function using beta-trace protein: Impact of dialysis procedures.","Beta-trace protein (BTP), a low molecular weight protein of 23-29 kDa, has been proposed as a promising biomarker to estimate residual renal function (RRF) in patients on maintenance hemodialysis (HD). Indeed, BTP is cleared by native kidney but not during conventional HD session. By contrast, the removal rate of BTP using convective processes (mainly hemodiafiltration [HDF]) and peritoneal dialysis (PD) has been little or not investigated. Therefore, an aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of dialysis procedures (high-flux HD, on-line post-dilution HDF and PD) on BTP removal in comparison with beta-2 microglobulin (B2M) and cystatin C (CYSC) removals after a single session. In addition, the ability of BTP to predict RRF in PD was assessed. This observational cross-sectional study included a total of 82 stable chronic kidney disease patients, 53 patients were on maintenance dialysis (with n = 26 in HD and n = 27 in HDF) and 29 were on PD. Serum concentrations of BTP, B2M, and CYSC were measured (a) before and after a single dialysis session in HD and HDF anuric patients to calculate reduction percentages, (b) in serum, 24-hour-dialysate and 24-hour-urine in PD patients to compute total, peritoneal, and urinary clearance. RRF was estimated using four equations developed for dialysis patients without urine collection and compared to the mean of the urea and creatinine clearances in PD. The concentrations of the three studied molecules were significantly reduced (P < .001) after dialysis session with significantly higher reduction ratio using HDF compared to HD modality (P < .001): BTP 49.3% vs 17.5%; B2M 82.3% vs 69.7%; CYSC 77.4% vs 66% in HDF and HD, respectively.

The minichromosome maintenance (MCM) family involve in DNA replication and is vital in limiting replication in cell cycle. The prognostic role of MCMs in MM is still unclear. We took four independent GEO datasets to analyze the relationship between the expression of MCMs and myeloma progression and survival. The expression of MCMs showed an upward trend with myeloma progression in 205 patients. High MCM2/3/4/6/8 expression was associated with both poor EFS and OS (all p < 0.050). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that high MCM2 expression, B2M, and LDH were independent risk factors. Moreover, the combination of MCM2/B2M and MCM2/LDH was a better tool in prognostication. In conclusion, high MCM2 expression is an independent adverse prognostic factor and could be used as a prognostic biomarker in MM.","1476-5500","Cancer gene therapy","(27) 819-829",2020,"Liang","Quan","L","Department of Hematology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, 510260, Guangzhou, China."

In present study, we designed to investigate the effects of TLR4 on B2M-induced age-related cognitive decline. Wild-type (WT) C57BL/6, TLR4 knockout (TLR4 -KO) mice and hippocampal neurons from the two type mice were respectively divided into two groups: (1) Veh group; (2) B2M-treated group. The behavioral responses of mice were measured using Morris Water Maze. Hippocampal neurogenesis and neuronal damage, inflammatory response, apoptosis, synaptic proteins and neurotrophic factors, and TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB signaling pathway proteins were examined using molecular biological or histopathological methods. The results showed that WT mice received B2M in the DG exhibited age-related cognitive declines, increased TLR4 mRNA expression and high levels of interleukin-1β (IL-1β), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and apoptotic neuronal death in the hippocampus, which were partially attenuated in TLR4-KO mice. Moreover, in absence of TLR4, B2M treatment improved hippocampus neurogenesis and increased synaptic related proteins. Our cell experiments further demonstrated that deletion of TLR4 could significantly increase synaptic related protein, decrease neuroinflammatory fators, inhibited apoptotic neuronal death, and regulated MyD88/NF-κB signal pathway after B2M treatment. In summary, our results support the TLR4 contributes to B2M-induced age-related cognitive decline due to neuroinflammation and apoptosis through TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB signaling pathway via a modulation of hippocampal neurogenesis and synaptic function. This may provide an important neuroprotective mechanism for improving age-related cognitive decline.","1756-6606","Molecular brain","(13) 20",2020,"Qi","Zhong","Q","Department of Anesthesiology, Zhongnan Hospital, Wuhan University, East Lake Road, Wuhan, 430071, Hubei, China."

The disease complexity and heterogeneity underscore the need for multiplex quantification of different markers. The goal of this study was to determine the association of six previously reported CKD-associated plasma proteins [B2M (Beta-2-microglobulin), SERPINF1 (Pigment epithelium-derived factor), AMBP (Protein AMBP), LYZ (Lysozyme C), HBB (Hemoglobin subunit beta) and IGHA1 (Immunoglobulin heavy constant alpha 1)], as measured in a multiplex format, with kidney function, and outcome. Antibody-free, multiple reaction monitoring mass spectrometry (MRM) assays were developed, characterized for their analytical performance, and used for the analysis of 72 plasma samples from a patient cohort with longitudinal follow-up. The MRM significantly correlated (Rho = 0.5-0.9) with results from respective ELISA. Five proteins [AMBP, B2M, LYZ, HBB and SERPINF1] were significantly associated with eGFR, with the three former also associated with unfavorable outcome. The combination of these markers provided stronger associations with outcome (p < 0.0001) compared to individual markers. Collectively, our study describes a multiplex assay for absolute quantification and verification analysis of previously described putative CKD prognostic markers, laying the groundwork for further use in prospective validation studies.","2045-2322","Scientific reports","(10) 4815",2020,"Manousos","Makridakis","M","Biotechnology Division, Biomedical Research Foundation, Academy of Athens (BRFAA), Athens, Greece."

Thirty-six beef cattle animals were used, consisting of Angus, Brahman and Nguni breeds, with each breed contributing 12 animals. Half of the animals per breed were artificially challenged with Rhipicephalus microplus and the other half with R. decoloratus unfed larvae per animal. Skin biopsies and blood samples were collected pre-infestation and 12 h post-infestation from the feeding sites of visibly engorging ticks. The success rate of the ticks was high and had an influence even at the early time point. Increased lymphocytes and blood urea nitrogen levels as well as decreased levels of segmented neutrophils were observed in the Angus, which were the opposite of those in the Brahman and Nguni. The increase in cholesterol, which was highest in the Angus and lowest in the Nguni, may be due to altered protein metabolism. The expression profiles of genes TRAF6, TBP, LUM and B2M were significantly different among breeds. Five genes (CCR1, TLR5, TRAF6, TBP, BDA20) had increased or constant expression post-infestation, whereas the expression of CXCL8, IL-10 and TNF-α decreased or remained the same after tick challenge. Genes that showed variation are involved in discouraging long-term supply of blood meal to the tick and those associated with immune responses. The gene LUM is a potential biomarker for tick resistance in cattle. The response to infestation by the breeds was consistent across the tick species.","1572-9702","Experimental & applied acarology","(80) 569-590",2020,"J K","Marima","JK","Department of Animal Sciences, Faculty of AgriSciences, Stellenbosch University, Private Bag X1, Matieland, 7602, South Africa."

The present study was conducted to compare the effectiveness in removals of protein-bound (indoxyl sulfate [IS]), middle-molecule [beta-2 microglobulin (B2M) and alpha-1 microglobulin (A1MG)], and small-molecule uremic toxins between super high-flux HD (SHF-HD), HD with a novel SHF dialyzer and high-volume postdilution ol-HDF in a noninferiority fashion. Fifteen prevalent HD patients were randomly allocated into two sequences of 12-week treatment periods of SHF-HD treatment and later high-volume postdilution ol-HDF period or vice versa. Each treatment period was divided by a wash-out phase of 4-week high-flux HD. Twelve of 15 patients could complete the study. When compared with high-volume postdilution ol-HDF (convective volume of 24.4 ± 3.52 L), SHF-HD provided comparable reduction ratio values of IS, B2M, and A1MG with mean difference of 5.87 (95% confidence interval [CI] -1.63, 13.37), 1.98 (95% CI,-0.21, 4.18), and 22.96 (95% CI, -1.91, 47.83), respectively. The spKt/Vurea was not different. The predialysis levels of all uremic toxins at baseline and after 12-week treatment did not differ between both groups. Although albumin loss in dialysate in SHF-HD was greater than high-volume postdilution ol-HDF, the serum albumin levels after 12-week SHF-HD treatment were significantly higher than baseline. In conclusion, SHF-HD provides noninferior effectiveness to high-volume postdilution ol-HDF in removing various uremic toxins with significantly increased serum albumin levels despite higher albumin loss. SHF-HD might be an effectively alternative treatment when high-volume postdilution ol-HDF is not available.","1744-9987","Therapeutic apheresis and dialysis : official peer-reviewed journal of the International Society for Apheresis, the Japanese Society for Apheresis, the Japanese Society for Dialysis Therapy","(25) 73-81",2021,"Theerachai","Thammathiwat","T","Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Thai Red Cross Society and Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand."

We performed capture-based targeted sequencing on baseline samples of 105 DLBCL patients using a panel consisting of 112 lymphoma-related genes. Subsequently, 81 treatment-naïve patients with measurable disease and followed for over 1 year were included for survival analysis. Collectively, the most commonly seen mutations included IGH fusion (69%), PIM1(33%), MYD88 (29%), BCL2 (29%), TP53 (29%), CD79B (25%) and KMT2D (24%). Patients with TP53 mutations were more likely to have primary refractory disease (87.0% vs 50.0%, P = .009). For those with TP53 disruptive mutations, 91.7% patients were in the primary refractory group. Interestingly, BCL-2 somatic hypermutation was only seen in patients without primary refractory disease (P = .014).

Furthermore, TP53 mutations was correlated with worse overall survival (P = .049). Next, we investigated mutation landscape in patients with wild-type (WT) TP53 (n = 58) and found that patients harboring MYD88 L265P had significantly inferior TTP than those with WT or non-265P (P = .046).

The Mayo 2012 stage and increased bone marrow plasma cell (BMPC) percentage are known predictors for survival. Increased B2M is predictive of survival in patients with multiple myeloma. We evaluated the prognostic role of B2M in patients with newly diagnosed AL undergoing ASCT. We retrospectively reviewed patients with a diagnosis of AL amyloidosis who were treated with ASCT between July 1996 and September 2017. Patients with a creatinine level >1.2 mg/dL were excluded, because that affects B2M levels. The receiver operator characteristic curve was used to determine the best cutoff for B2M before ASCT in predicting survival, which was 2.5 µg/mL, which was also the upper limit of normal in our laboratory. Baseline characteristics were compared between patients with B2M >2.5 µg/mL and ≤2.5 µg/mL. Progression-free survival (PFS) was defined as the time from ASCT to relapse or death, whichever occurred first. Overall survival (OS) was calculated from the time of ASCT to death of any cause. Univariate and multivariate analyses were done for OS. Five hundred and ten patients were identified, 222 of whom (44%) had a B2M >2.5 µg/mL. These patients were more likely to be older (median age, 61 versus 57 years; P = .0002), to have Mayo 2012 stage III/IV disease (33% versus 8%; P < .0001), to have more than 2 organs involved (25% versus 14%; P = .001), and to have ≥10% BMPCs (56% versus 40%; P = .0002) compared with patients with B2M ≤2.5 µg/mL.

Given fundamental interaction of MHC class I with CD8+ T-cells, we hypothesized that expression of MHC class I associated protein, beta-2-microglobulin (B2M), may be an important immunologic marker in RCC. We sought to understand potential implications of CD8 + TILs and tumor B2M expression on overall survival and response to high-dose interleukin-2 (IL-2) therapy, in a cohort of patients with high-stage (clinical stage III and IV) ccRCC. Four tumor regions from 56 patients with ccRCC were retrospectively assessed immunohistochemically. At a median follow-up time of 33 months, 22 (39%) patients had died of disease, 23 (41%) were alive disease, and 11 (20%) had no evidence of disease. Tumors with high CD8 + TILs had a significantly lower death rate [hazard ratio (HR): 0.33, p = 0.02]. CD8 + TILs correlated with B2M expression (p = 0.007). On multivariable analyses, patients with both high B2M and CD8 + TILs had lower death rate (HR: 0.27, p = 0.03). Within the subgroup treated with IL-2 (n = 27, 48%), tumors with high CD8 + TILs were more likely to respond to IL-2 therapy [coefficient (coef): 1.6, p = 0.05]. On multivariable analyses, tumors with a combination of both high B2M expression and high CD8 + TILs also showed trend to responding to IL-2 therapy (coef: 2.5, p = 0.06). In conclusion, abundant CD8+ TILs and high tumor expression of beta-2-microglobulin were good prognostic indicators associated with longer survival in patients with high-stage ccRCC.

A broad spectrum of immune cells, including T cells, natural killer (NK) cells, and antigen-presenting cells, which either cause direct cell killing or constitute an immunogenic environment, are involved in allograft immune rejection. A strategy to protect donor cells from cytotoxicity while decreasing the secretion of inflammatory cytokines of lymphocytes is still lacking. Here, we engineered hPSCs with no surface expression of classical human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I proteins via beta-2 microglobulin (B2M) knockout or biallelic knockin of HLA-G1 within the frame of endogenous B2M loci. Elimination of the surface expression of HLA class I proteins protected the engineered hPSCs from cytotoxicity mediated by T cells. However, this lack of surface expression also resulted in missing-self response and NK cell activation, which were largely compromised by expression of β2m-HLA-G1 fusion proteins. We also proved that the engineered β2m-HLA-G5 fusion proteins were soluble, secretable, and capable of safeguarding low immunogenic environments by lowering inflammatory cytokines secretion in allografts. Our current study reveals a novel strategy that may offer unique advantages to construct hypoimmunogenic hPSCs via the expression of membrane-bound and secreted β2m-HLA-G fusion proteins. These engineered hPSCs are expected to serve as an unlimited cell source for generating universally compatible ""off-the-shelf"" cell grafts in the future.","1549-4918","Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)","(38) 1423-1437",2020,"Lei","Shi","L","College of Animal Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, People's Republic of China."

Exomes of 21 GZL and 7 poly-EBV-L cases, along with paired constitutional DNA, were analyzed as a discovery cohort, followed by targeted sequencing of 217 genes in an extension cohort of 29 GZL and 13 poly-EBV-L cases. GZL cases with thymic niche involvement (anterior mediastinal mass) exhibited a mutation profile closely resembling cHL and PMBCL, with SOCS1 (45%), B2M (45%), TNFAIP3 (35%), GNA13 (35%), LRRN3 (32%), and NFKBIA (29%) being the most recurrently mutated genes. In contrast, GZL cases without thymic niche involvement (n = 18) had a significantly distinct pattern that was enriched in mutations related to apoptosis defects (TP53 [39%], BCL2 [28%], BIRC6 [22%]) and depleted in GNA13, XPO1, or NF-κB signaling pathway mutations (TNFAIP3, NFKBIE, IKBKB, NFKBIA). They also exhibited more BCL2/BCL6 rearrangements compared with thymic GZL. Poly-EBV-L cases presented a distinct mutational profile, including STAT3 mutations and a significantly lower coding mutation load in comparison with EBV- GZL.

Because iPSCs can differentiate into any types of cells in the body and have fewer ethical issues compared to embryonic stem (ES) cells, application of iPSCs for regenerative medicine has been actively examined. In fact, iPSCs have already been used for clinical applications, but at present, only autologous iPSC-derived grafts or HLA homozygous iPSC-derived grafts are being transplanted into patients following HLA matching. HLA is an important molecule that enables the immune system differentiates between self and non-self-components; thus, HLA mismatch is a major hurdle in the transplantation of iPSCs. To deliver inexpensive off-the-shelf iPSC-derived regenerative medicine products to more patients, it is necessary to generate universal iPSCs that can be transplanted regardless of the HLA haplotypes. The current strategy to generate universal iPSCs has two broad aims: deleting HLA expression and avoiding attacks from NK cells, which are caused by HLA deletion. Deletion of B2M and CIITA genes using the CRISPR/Cas9 system has been reported to suppress the expression of HLA class I and class II, respectively. Transduction of NK inhibitory ligands, such as HLA-E and CD47, has been used to avoid NK cell attacks. Most recently, the HLA-C retaining method has been used to generate semi-universal iPSCs. Twelve haplotypes of HLA-C retaining iPSCs can cover 95% of the global population. In future, studying which types of universal iPSCs are most effective for engraftment in various physiological conditions is necessary.","1880-9693","Inflammation and regeneration","(40) 23",2020,"Keiko","Koga","K","Takeda-CiRA Joint Program (T-CiRA), 2-26-1, Muraoka-Higashi, Fujisawa, Kanagawa 251-8555 Japan."

However, host rejection driven by HLA disparity in adoptively transferred allogeneic T cells remains a key obstacle to the universal donor T cell therapy. To evade donor HLA-mediated immune rejection, we attempted to eliminate T cell's HLA through the CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing system. First, we screened 60 gRNAs targeting B2M and multiple sets of gRNA each targeting α chains of HLA-II (DPA, DQA and DRA, respectively) using web-based design tools, and identified specific gRNA sequences highly efficient for target deletion without carrying off-target effects. Multiplex genome editing of primary human T cells achieved by the newly discovered gRNAs yielded HLA-I- or HLA-I/II-deficient T cells that were phenotypically unaltered and functionally intact. The overnight mixed lymphocyte reactions demonstrated the HLA-I-negative cells induced decreased production of IFN-γ and TNF-α in alloreactive T cells, and deficiency of HLA-I/II in T cells further dampened the inflammatory responses. Taken together, our approach will provide an efficacious pathway toward the universal donor cell generation by manipulating HLA expression in therapeutic T cells.","2045-2322","Scientific reports","(10) 17753",2020,"Jeewon","Lee","J","MOGAM Institute for Biomedical Research, 93, 30beon-gil, Ihyeon-ro, Giheung-gu, Yongin-si, Gyeonggi-do, 16924, South Korea."

Immunotherapy has shown its potential application in a variety of refractory malignancies. Due to the complexity of immune microenvironment of hepatocellular carcinoma, the efficacy of immunotherapy for hepatocellular carcinoma is not as effective as expected. Expression data of hepatocellular carcinoma from the TCGA and ICGC databases were used for classification and verification of hepatocellular carcinoma subtypes. The immune-related functions and pathways were identified via gene set enrichment analysis, while the sections denoting the subsets of the immune cells were estimated using the CIBERSORT algorithm. Immunity low (Immunity_L), immunity medium (Immunity_M), and immunity high (Immunity_H) were specified as the three immune-related subtypes of hepatocellular carcinoma. The quantity of stromal and immune cells was the most substantial in Immunity_H, compared to the other subtypes. Interestingly, the proportion of M0 macrophages decreased from Immunity_L to Immunity_H, while the proportion of CD8 T cells increased. Furthermore, the HLA genes expression levels, as well as those of six immune checkpoint genes were substantially lower in Immunity_L than in Immunity_H. Functional analysis was performed for 1512 differentially expressed genes between Immunity_L and Immunity_H. Finally, the PPI network was constructed with 118 nodes. The highest connectivity degree nodes were B2M, HLA-DRA, and HLA-DRB1. The above results were verified in ICGC-JP and ICGC-FR databases with a consistent trend. In this study, we divided hepatocellular carcinoma into three subtypes and explored the immune-related characteristics of these subtypes.

33284559,"Interaction network of proteins associated with unfavorable prognosis in acute myeloid leukemia.","Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a malignant disorder of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, characterized by accumulation of immature blasts in the bone marrow and peripheral blood of affected patients. Standard induction therapy leads to complete remission in approximately 50% to 75% of patients. In spite of favorable primary response rates, only 20% to 30% of patients enjoy long-term disease free survival. Identifying proteins involved in prognosis is important for proposing biomarkers that can aid in the clinical management of the disease. The aim of this study was to construct a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network based on serum proteins associated with unfavorable prognosis of AML, and analyze the biological pathways underlying molecular complexes in the network. We identified 16 candidate serum proteins associated with unfavorable prognosis (in terms of poor response to treatment, poor overall survival, short complete remission, and relapse) in AML via a search in the literature: IL2RA, FTL, HSP90AA1, D2HGDH, PLAU, COL18A1, FGF19, SPP1, FGA, PF4, NME1, TNF, ANGPT2, B2M, CD274, LGALS3. The PPI network was constructed with Cytoscape using association networks from String and BioGRID, and Gene Ontology enrichment analysis using the ClueGo pluggin was performed. The central protein in the network was found to be PTPN11 which is involved in modulating the RAS-ERK, PI3K-AKT and JAK-STAT pathways, as well as in hematopoiesis, and in the regulation of apoptotic genes. Therefore, a dysregulation of this protein and/or of the proteins connected to it in the network leads to the defective activation of these signaling pathways and to a reduction in apoptosis. Together, this could cause an increase in the frequency of leukemic cells and a resistance to apoptosis in response to treatment.","1734-154X","Acta biochimica Polonica","(67) 475-483",2020,"Juan Jose","Rendon-Rodriguez","JJ","Biomedical Innovation and Research Group, Faculty of Applied and Exact Sciences, Instituto Tecnologico Metropolitano ITM, 050034 Medellin, Colombia."

However, current tests normally use solitary type of biomarkers, and are limited by unsatisfactory sensitivity and specificity when applied to differentiate cancer patients from healthy controls. In this study, a combined approach of CEA and salivary mRNA biomarkers was evaluated for discriminatory performance of ovarian cancer patients from healthy controls. We designed our study with two phases: a discovery phase to find and evaluate multiple biomarkers, and an independent validation phase to confirm the applicability of the selected biomarkers. In the discovery phase, a total of 140 ovarian cancer patients and 140 healthy controls were recruited. The CEA level in blood as well as five mRNA biomarkers in saliva (i.e. AGPAT1, B2M, BASP1, IER3 and IL1β) were measured, followed by developing a machine-learning model to differentiate ovarian cancer patients and healthy controls. We found a novel panel of biomarkers, which could differentiate ovarian cancer patients from healthy controls with high sensitivity (89.3%) and high specificity (82.9%). Next, we applied this panel of biomarkers in an independent validation study that consisted of 60 ovarian cancer patients and 60 healthy controls. The ovarian cancer patients were successfully differentiated from healthy controls in the validation phase, with sensitivity reaching 85.0% and specificity reaching 88.3%.

Here, we report the empirical application of a targeted 40-gene panel developed for use in mature lymphoid neoplasms (MLNs) and report our experience on over 500 cases submitted for MPS during the first year of its clinical use. MPS was applied to both fresh and fixed specimens. The most frequent diagnoses were diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (116), chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (60), marginal zone lymphoma (52), and follicular lymphoma (43), followed by a spectrum of mature T-cell neoplasms (40). Of 534 cases submitted, 471 generated reportable results in MLNs, with disease-associated variants (DAVs) detected in 241 cases (51.2%). The most frequent DAVs affected TP53 (30%), CREBBP (14%), MYD88 (14%), TNFRSF14 (10%), TNFAIP3 (10%), B2M (7%), and NOTCH2 (7%). The bulk of our findings confirm what is reported in the scientific literature. While a substantial majority of mutations did not directly impact diagnosis, MPS results were utilized to either change, refine, or facilitate the final diagnosis in ~10.8% of cases with DAVs and 5.5% of cases overall. In addition, we identified preanalytic variables that significantly affect assay performance highlighting items for specimen triage. We demonstrate the technical viability and utility of the judicious use of a targeted MPS panel that may help to establish general guidelines for specimen selection and diagnostic application in MLNs in routine clinical practice.","1530-0285","Modern pathology : an official journal of the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology, Inc","(34) 904-921",2021,"Adam R","Davis","AR","Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania and Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA."

Despite its importance to mechanistic studies, no evaluation of RG stability has been conducted for pregnant human myometrium. A systematic search of the literature was performed to identify the most used RGs in human myometrial gene expression studies. The stability of these genes, and others, was then evaluated using geNorm and NormFinder algorithms, in samples of myometrium from singleton or twin pregnancies (n = 7 per group) delivering at term or preterm. The most frequently cited RGs were GAPDH, ACTB, B2M and 18s. There was strong agreement between algorithms on the most and least stable genes: Both indicated CYC1, YWHAZ and ATP5B were the most stably expressed. Despite being some of the most used RGs, B2M, 18s and ACTB expression was least stable and was too variable for use as accurate normalisation factors. Pairwise variation analysis determined that the optimal number of RGs for accurate normalisation is two. Validation of the choice of RGs by comparing relative expression of oxytocin receptors (OXTR) using the least stable 18s and B2M, with the most stable, CYC1 and YWHAZ, erroneously demonstrated significantly increased OXTR expression in myometrium in singleton pregnancies compared to twins. This study demonstrates the importance of appropriate RG selection for accurate quantification of relative expression in pregnant human myometrium qPCR studies. For normalisation, the geometric mean of CYC1 and YWHAZ or ATP5B is suggested.

Amongst, aluminum, calcium, copper, iron, and magnesium protein hubs are the key regulators showing the ability to classify PD from control based on thirty-four classification algorithms. Analysis of these five metal proteins hubs showed involvement in environmental information processing, immune, neuronal, endocrine, aging, and signal transduction pathways. Furthermore, gene expression of functional protein in each hub showed significant upregulation of EFEMP2, MMP9, B2M, MEAF2A, and TARDBP in PD. Dysregulating hub proteins imprint the metal availability in a biological system. Hence, metal concentration in serum and cerebrospinal fluid were tested, which were altered and showed significant contribution towards gene expression of metal hub proteins along with the previously reported PD markers.

Methods The expression of five potential housekeeping genes GAPDH, RPNI, PUM1, B2M, and PMM1 was analyzed through qPCR and Bestkeeper software (http://www.wzw.tum.de/gene-quantification/bestkeeper.html) in 20 stage II-IV rectal cancer samples to check for uniformity in their expression pattern. Cancer stem cell (CSC) marker ALDH1 and epithelial-mesenchymal transition marker (EMT) markers E cadherin, vimentin, Twist, and SNAI2 expression were evaluated in conjunction with the two optimal reference genes in 10 rectal cancers as part of validation. Results The standard deviation of the cycle threshold value of GAPDH was found the lowest at 0.65 followed by RPN1 at 0.88, PUM1 at 0.94, PMM1 at 0.94, and B2M at 1.21 when analyzed with BestKeeper software. Using GAPDH and PUM1 as the reference gene for the validation phase, rectal cancer patients with stage III/IV showed a 4.79-fold change (P=0.006) in ALDH1 expression, and an 11.76-fold change in Twist expression (P=0.003) with respect to stage II rectal tumor when normalized with GAPDH and PUM1. Conclusion GAPDH and PUM1 can be used as an optimal set of housekeeping genes for gene expression-related experiments in rectal tumors. ALDH1 and Twist were found significantly overexpressed in stage III/IV rectal tumors in comparison to stage II rectal cancer. Genes associated with cancer stem cells and EMT markers could be optimally analyzed by normalizing them with GAPDH and PUM1 as housekeeping genes.","2168-8184","Cureus","(12) e12020",2020,"Litika","Vermani","L","Biotechnology, Mizoram University, Aizawl, IND."

The RNA content of small extracellular vesicles including exosomes is growingly considered as cancer biomarkers. So, reliable relative quantification of exosomal messenger RNA (mRNA) is essential for cancer diagnosis and prognosis applications. However, suitable reference genes for accurate normalization of a target gene in exosomes derived from cancer cells are not depicted yet. Here, we analyzed the expression and stability of eight well-known reference genes namely GAPDH, B2M, HPRT1, ACTB, YWHAZ, UBC, RNA18S, and TBP in exosomes-isolated from the liver (Huh7, HepG2, PLC/PRF/5) and breast (SK-BR-3) cancer cell lines using five different algorithms including geNorm, BestKeeper, Delta Ct, NormFinder, and RefFinder. Our results showed that ACTB, TBP, and HPRT1 were not expressed in exosomes-isolated from studied liver and breast cancer cell lines. The geNorm and BestKeeper algorithms indicated GAPDH and UBC as the most stable candidates. Moreover, Delta Ct and NormFinder algorithms showed YWHAZ as the most stable reference genes. Comprehensive ranking calculated by the RefFinder algorithm also pointed out GAPDH, YWHAZ, and UBC as the first three stable reference genes. Taken together, this study validated the common reference genes stability in exosomal mRNA derived from liver and breast cancer cell lines for the first time.

These recommended internal reference gene selections may improve the accuracy and reproducibility of RT-qPCR in gene expression analyses of NF1 related tumors.","1932-6203","PloS one","(16) e0241821",2021,"Yi-Hui","Gu","YH","Department of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China."

Here, we explored the potential of β2-microglobulin (B2M) to serve as a hopeful candidate for immunotherapy or diagnostic biomarker in gliomas. The genomic profiles, clinical characteristics, and immune signatures were analyzed based on TCGA and CGGA databases. We carried out the whole statistical analyses using R project. High B2M expression correlated with worse prognosis. Somatic mutations of gliomas with high B2M expression are associated with PTEN deletion and EGFR amplification. Isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutations accounted for 82% in gliomas with low B2M expression. In addition, B2M positively correlated with ESTIMATE scores, interacted with infiltrating immune and stromal cell types. B2M also suppressed anti-tumor immunity through immune related processes. Meanwhile, B2M was associated with immune checkpoint molecules and inflammatory activities. Finally, functional annotation of the identified B2M related genes verified that B2M was a potential candidate for immunotherapy. We confirmed that B2M played a critical role in tumor progression, patient prognosis and immunotherapy of gliomas.","2045-2322","Scientific reports","(11) 5045",2021,"Hao","Zhang","H","Department of Neurosurgery, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, 410008, Hunan, People's Republic of China."
33661977,"Flow Assisted Mutation Enrichment (FAME): A highly efficacious and efficient method to enrich Double Knockouts (DKO) after gene editing.","Gene editing has become an essential tool for interrogation of gene function in biomedical research and is also a promising approach for gene therapy. Despite recent progresses, the gene-editing procedure is still a tedious process involving manually isolating large number of single cell colonies to screen for desired mutations. For diploid eukaryotic cells, there is the additional challenge to inactivate both alleles for genes-of-interest, i.e., generating double knockouts (DKOs), for the desired phenotypes or therapeutic effects. In this report, we present a novel method based on Fluorescence Assisted Cell Sorting (FACS) to enrich for DKO cells, using a cell surface marker β2-microglobulin (B2M) as a basis for negative selection. This method significantly increased percentage of DKOs in isolated cells after gene editing, and in the meantime, significantly improve the efficiency of workflow by automating colony isolation.

Commercial RNA extraction kits are often expensive, in limited supply, and do not always fully inactivate the virus. Together, this calls for the development of safer methods for SARS-CoV-2 extraction that utilize readily available reagents and equipment present in most standard laboratories. We optimized and simplified a RNA extraction method combining a high molar acidic guanidinium isothiocyanate (GITC) solution, phenol and chloroform. First, we determined the GITC/RNA dilution thresholds compatible with an efficient two-step RT-qPCR for B2M mRNA in nasopharyngeal (NP) or oropharyngeal (OP) swab samples. Second, we optimized a one-step RT-qPCR against SARS-CoV-2 using NP and OP samples. We furthermore tested a SARS-CoV-2 dilution series to determine the detection threshold. The method enables downstream detection of SARS-CoV-2 by RT-qPCR with high sensitivity (~4 viral RNA copies per RT-qPCR). The protocol is simple, safe, and expands analysis capacity as the inactivated samples can be used in RT-qPCR detection tests at laboratories not otherwise classified for viral work. The method takes about 30 min from swab to PCR-ready viral RNA and circumvents the need for commercial RNA purification kits.","1600-0463","APMIS : acta pathologica, microbiologica, et immunologica Scandinavica","(129) 393-400",2021,"Lelde","Kalnina","L","Center for Genomic Medicine, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark."

Recent studies have postulated their role in the development of chronic kidney disease of unknown etiology (CKDu). Paraquat and glyphosate are leading herbicides used by sugarcane farmers (SF), hence occupational exposure is inevitable. This study examined the expression of urinary paraquat, glyphosate and biomarkers among residential SF in CKDu emerging regions, Warunagama (WA) and Rahathangama (RH), in the Uva Province with non-endemic Matara (MA) in the Southern Province of Sri Lanka. Urinary glyphosate, Paraquat, kidney injury molecule -1 (KIM-1), neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) and β2-microglobulin (B2M) were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). Urinary creatinine, microalbumin, serum creatinine (SCr), serum cystatin C, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and albumin creatinine ratio (ACR) were also assessed. Generally, herbicide residues and kidney injury biomarkers were higher in SF compared to the non-endemic MA. Creatinine-adjusted urinary glyphosate and paraquat levels were significantly higher in WA compared to MA. ACR in RH (median 14.9; IQR 5.4-393.1 mg/g) and WA (23.7; 11.5-64.6) was significantly higher than MA (4.3; 2.2-6.7). This study reports 39 individuals with impaired kidney function among SF in Sri Lanka for the first time. Urinary NGAL levels were significantly higher in both WA (median 2.14; IQR 1.28-6.15 ng/mg Cr) and RH (3.09; 1.15-9.09) compared to MA (1.28; 0.56-2.81). However, urinary KIM-1 levels in RH (3.2; 1.29-106.1 ng/g Cr) and WA (3.6; 1.94-115.1) were not significantly higher in MA (1.74; 0.76-116.9). Urinary NGAL (r = 0.493), eGFR (r = -0.147) and ACR (r = 0.171) significantly correlated with urinary glyphosate, but not with urinary paraquat levels. Urinary KIM-1 levels did not correlate with either urinary glyphosate or paraquat, while urinary B2M and serum cystatin C levels showed significant correlation with urinary glyphosate levels. The current study reports higher urinary herbicide levels among sugarcane farmers in WA and RH, and that is potentially linked to the subsequent decline in kidney function, as indicated by ACR, eGFR, and NGAL. We posit that these indicators may serve as markers to detect renal injury among herbicide-exposed SF in Rural Sri Lanka.","1660-4601","International journal of environmental research and public health","3278",2021,"K S M","Abdul","KSM","Institute of Biomedical and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Guangdong University of Technology, Guangzhou 510006, China."

In order to screen the reference genes suitable for detecting gene expression in tissues of the reproductive axis, a total of 420 (males and females = 1:5) 3-year-old Magang geese were selected and subjected to light treatment. The hypothalamus, pituitary and testicular tissues were subsequently collected at different stages. Ten genes including HPRT1, GAPDH, ACTB, LDHA, SDHA, B2M, TUBB4, TFRC, RPS2 and RPL4 were selected as candidate reference genes. The expression of these genes in goose reproductive axis tissues was detected by real-time fluorescent quantitative PCR. The ΔCT, geNorm, NormFinder and BestKeeper algorithms were applied to sort gene expression according to stability. The results showed that ACTB and TUBB4 were the most suitable reference genes for the hypothalamic tissue of Magang goose in the three breeding stages; HPRT1 and RPL4 for pituitary tissue; and HPRT1 and LDHA for testicular tissue. For all three reproductive axis tissues, ACTB was the most suitable reference gene, whereas the least stable reference gene was GAPDH.

This study aimed to investigate the immune-related prognostic gene signatures in the tumor microenvironment of sarcoma. The RNA-sequencing data and clinical phenotype data of 260 sarcoma samples and two normal samples were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atla (TCGA) database. Tumor purity and immune cells infiltration were evaluated by Estimation of Stromal and Immune cells in Malignant Tumors using Expression data (ESTIMATE) deconvolution algorithm. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were screened in high vs. low immune score groups. Survival analysis was performed using Kaplan-Meier curve with log-rank test. Tumor infiltrating of immune cells was analyzed by Tumor Immune Estimation Resource (TIMER). High immune score and ESTIMATE score were associated with favorable prognosis. A total of 623 immune DEGs were screened. The majority of these genes (532 genes accounting for 85% of the DEGs) were up-regulated, and these genes were significantly enriched in various immune related biological processed and pathways, such as neutrophil activation, T cell activation, antigen processing and presentation. A total of 146 prognosis-related immune DEGs, and seven hub genes were identified, including B2M, HLA-DRB1, HLA-DRA, HLA-E, LCK, HLA-DPA1, and VAV1. Survival analysis showed that high expression of these genes was associated with a favorable prognosis. There were negative correlations between the expression of these hub genes and tumor purity, while positive correlations between expression of these hub genes and f infiltration levels of B cells, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, neutrophils, macrophages and dendritic cells. These results help to stratify patients with different immune subtypes and help to design immunotherapy strategies for these patients in sarcoma.","1551-0018","Mathematical biosciences and engineering : MBE","(18) 2243-2257",2021,"Jun","Wang","J","Department of Orthopedics and Trauma, The Second Hospital of Shandong University, No. 247 Beiyuan Street, Jinan, 250033, China."

Their demographic characteristics were obtained, and the levels of serum creatinine (Scr), beta2-microglobulin (B2M), and cystatin C (CysC) (to assess renal function) were measured. Serum HE4 concentration was determined by electrochemiluminescence. Serum HE4 levels in patients with CKD were significantly higher than those in the control group (P < 0.001). Meanwhile, there were significant differences in HE4 levels among the four CKD subgroups (P < 0.001) via multiple comparisons. In addition, the diagnostic value of HE4 was significantly higher than other indicators by ROC curve analysis.

Instead, studies of platelet gene function depend on alternative models. Megakaryocytes (the nucleated precursor to platelets) are the nearest cell to platelets in origin, structure, and function. However, achieving consistent genetic modifications in primary megakaryocytes has been challenging, and the functional effects of induced gene deletions on human megakaryocytes for even well-characterized platelet genes (eg, ITGA2B) are unknown. Here we present a rapid and systematic approach to screen genes for platelet functions in CD34+ cell-derived megakaryocytes called CRIMSON (CRISPR-edited megakaryocytes for rapid screening of platelet gene functions). By using CRISPR/Cas9, we achieved efficient nonviral gene editing of a panel of platelet genes in megakaryocytes without compromising megakaryopoiesis. Gene editing induced loss of protein in up to 95% of cells for platelet function genes GP6, RASGRP2, and ITGA2B; for the immune receptor component B2M; and for COMMD7, which was previously associated with cardiovascular disease and platelet function. Gene deletions affected several select responses to platelet agonists in megakaryocytes in a manner largely consistent with those expected for platelets. Deletion of B2M did not significantly affect platelet-like responses, whereas deletion of ITGA2B abolished agonist-induced integrin activation and spreading on fibrinogen without affecting the translocation of P-selectin. Deletion of GP6 abrogated responses to collagen receptor agonists but not thrombin. Deletion of RASGRP2 impaired functional responses to adenosine 5'-diphosphate (ADP), thrombin, and collagen receptor agonists. Deletion of COMMD7 significantly impaired multiple responses to platelet agonists. Together, our data recommend CRIMSON for rapid evaluation of platelet gene phenotype associations.","2473-9537","Blood advances","(5) 2362-2374",2021,"Emilie","Montenont","E","Molecular Medicine Program, The University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT."

Fluorescence in situ hybridization studies for MYC (break-apart probe), MYC/IGH, IGH/BCL2, and BCL6 rearrangements were performed on tissue microarrays. Immunohistochemical stains for CD10, BCL2, BCL6, and MYC were performed and scored on MYC-rearranged cases. On 4 FL cases, a custom targeted panel of 356 genes was used for mutation analysis. Ten cases (1.9%) were positive for MYC rearrangement. Histologically, 6 of 10 cases were grade 1-2, and 4 cases were grade 3A. By immunohistochemistry, 9 of 9 tested cases were CD10+, all cases were BCL6+, and 9/10 cases were BCL2+. MYC protein staining was low in all cases tested. IGH/BCL2 rearrangement was detected in 5 of 9 cases, whereas BCL6 rearrangement was detected in 3 of 7 tested cases and 4 of 10 cases showed MYC/IGH rearrangement. The most commonly detected mutations in the MYC-positive cases included HLA-B, TNFRSF14, and KMT2D. MYC and/or B2M abnormalities were detected in 2 cases. In conclusion, MYC rearrangement is uncommon in FL and these cases do not appear to have specific histologic characteristics.

The prevalent view is that the elevated and dynamic neoantigen burden associated with the mutator phenotype of MMRd fosters enhanced immune surveillance of these cancers. In addition, recent findings suggest that MMRd tumors have increased cytosolic DNA, which triggers the cGAS STING pathway, leading to interferon-mediated immune response. Unfortunately, approximately 30% of MMRd CRC exhibit primary resistance to CPIs, while a substantial fraction of tumors acquires resistance after an initial benefit. Profiling of clinical samples and preclinical studies suggests that alterations in the Wnt and the JAK-STAT signaling pathways are associated with refractoriness to CPIs. Intriguingly, mutations in the antigen presentation machinery, such as loss of MHC or Beta-2 microglobulin (B2M), are implicated in initial immune evasion but do not impair response to CPIs. In this review, we outline how understanding the mechanistic basis of immune evasion and CPI resistance in MMRd CRC provides the rationale for innovative strategies to increase the subset of patients benefiting from CPIs.","2072-6694","Cancers","2638",2021,"Vito","Amodio","V","Candiolo Cancer Institute, FPO-IRCCS, 10060 Candiolo, TO, Italy."
34115389,"B2M gene expression shapes the immune landscape of lung adenocarcinoma and determines the response to immunotherapy.","Loss of the B2M gene is associated with tumour immune escape and resistance to immunotherapy. However, genetic alterations of the B2M gene are rare. We performed an integrative analysis of the mutational and transcriptional profiles of large cohorts of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients and found that epigenetic downregulation of B2M is common. B2M-low tumours exhibit a suppressive immune microenvironment characterized by reduced infiltration of immune cells of various lineages; in B2M-high tumours, more T and natural killer cells are present, but their activities are constrained by immune checkpoint molecules, indicating the diverse mechanisms of immune evasion. High levels of B2M mRNA, but not PD-L1, are correlated with an enhanced response to PD-1-based immunotherapy, suggesting its value for immunotherapy response prediction in solid tumours. Notably, a high tumour mutation burden (TMB) is associated with low B2M expression, which may explain the poor predictive value of the TMB in some situations. In syngeneic mouse models, genetic ablation of B2M in tumour cells causes resistance to PD-1-based immunotherapy, and B2M knockdown also diminishes the therapeutic efficacy. Moreover, forced expression of B2M in tumour models improves the response to immunotherapy, suggesting that B2M levels have significant impacts on treatment outcomes. Finally, we provide insight into the roles of transcription factors and KRAS mutations in B2M expression and the anticancer immune response. In conclusion, genetic and epigenetic regulation of B2M fundamentally shapes the NSCLC immune microenvironment and may determine the response to checkpoint blockade-based immunotherapy.","1365-2567","Immunology","(164) 507-523",2021,"Yu","Zhao","Y","Department of Immunology, School of Medicine, Nantong University, Nantong, China."

This study aimed to screen out and determine the optimal panel of reference genes of the intestine in pre- and post-natal rats of different sex. We used qRT-PCR to detect the mRNA expression of six commonly used reference genes (ACTB, GAPDH, HPRT1, B2M, RPLPO and SDHA) in rat intestines at gestational day 21 (GD21) and postnatal week 12 (PW12). Using GeNorm, BestKeeper and NormFinder software comprehensively analyzed the stability of candidate reference genes and screened out stable reference genes. Further, we used the pathological model of prenatal dexamethasone exposure (PDE) to verify the stability of the selected panel of reference genes. Based on the results of the software analysis, the optimal panel of reference genes in the fetal rat intestine was SDHA + ACTB, and the adult rat small intestine and colon were ACTB + HPRT1 and RPLP0 + GAPDH, respectively. There was no significant sex difference in the above results. Besides, in the PDE model, the results were consistent with those under physiological conditions. Therefore, the stability of intestinal reference genes in fetal rats and adult rats was different, and the intestinal reference genes of adult rats were intestinal segments-specific. The selected panel of reference genes was still stable under pathological conditions. This study determined the optimal panel of reference genes of pre- and post-natal rat intestines and provided reliable reference genes for the qRT-PCR analysis of rat intestines.","1873-1708","Reproductive toxicology (Elmsford, N.Y.)","(104) 68-75",2021,"Xiaoqian","Lu","X","Department of Pharmacology, Basic Medical School of Wuhan University, Wuhan, 430071, China."

A total of 277 variants were detected in 36 of the 49 samples (73·5%) with a good quality ctDNA sample. The median number of variants detected per patient was five (range 1-23) with a median variant allele frequency of 4·2% (0·84-28%). Genotyping revealed somatic variants in the following genes: SOCS1 (28%), IGLL5 (26%), TNFAIP3 (23%), GNA13 (23%), STAT6 (21%) and B2M (19%). Moreover, several poor prognosis features (high LDH, low serum albumin, B-symptoms, IPI ≥ 3 or at an advanced stage) were related to significantly higher amounts of ctDNA.

The case-by-case autologous T cell generation setting is largely considered as a pivotal restraining cause for its large-scale clinical use because of the costly and prolonged manufacturing procedure. Further, activated CAR-T cells mainly express immune checkpoint molecules, including CTLA4, PD1, LAG3, abrogating CAR-T anti-tumor activity. In addition, CAR-T cell therapy potently results in some toxicity, such as cytokine releases syndrome (CRS). Therefore, the development of the universal allogeneic T cells with higher anti-tumor effects is of paramount importance. Thus, genome-editing technologies, in particular, clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-Cas9 are currently being used to establish ""off-the-shelf"" CAR-T cells with robust resistance to immune cell-suppressive molecules. In fact, that simultaneous ablation of PD-1, T cell receptor alpha constant (TRAC or TCR), and also β-2 microglobulin (B2M) by CRISPR-Cas9 technique can support the manufacture of universal CAR-T cells with robust resistance to PD-L1. . Indeed, the ablation of β2M or TARC can severely hinder swift elimination of allogeneic T cells those express foreign HLA-I molecules, and thereby enables the generation of CAR-T cells from allogeneic healthy donors T cells with higher persistence in vivo. Herein, we will deliver a brief overview of the CAR-T cell application in the context of tumor immunotherapy. More importantly, we will discuss recent finding concerning the application of genome editing technologies for preparing universal CAR-T cells or cells that can effectively counter tumor escape, with a special focus on CRISPR-Cas9 technology.","1757-6512","Stem cell research & therapy","(12) 428",2021,"Ehsan","Razeghian","E","Human Genetics Division, Medical Biotechnology Department, National Institute of Genetics Engineering and Biotechnology (NIGEB), Tehran, Iran."

Here, constitutive expression of mutant B2M-HLA-E (mBE) and B2M-HLA-G (mBG) fusion proteins in anti-CD19 UCAR T (UCAR T-19) cells was conducted to protect against allogeneic NK cell-mediated lysis. The ability of cells expressing mBE or mBG to resist NK cell-mediated lysis was observed in gene-edited Jurkat CAR19 cells. UCAR T-19 cells constitutively expressing the mBE and mBG fusion proteins were manufactured and showed effective and specific anti-tumor activity. Constitutive expression of the mBE and mBG fusion proteins in UCAR T-19 cells prevented allogeneic NK cell-mediated lysis. In addition, these cells were not recognizable by allogeneic T cells.

Aberrant platelet transcriptome is common in cancer or cardiovascular disease, but reference data on platelet RNA content in healthy individuals are scarce and merit complex investigation. We sought to explore the dynamics of platelet transcriptome. Datasets from 204 healthy donors were used for the analysis of splice variants, particularly with regard to age, sex, blood storage time, unit of collection or library size. Genes B2M, PPBP, TMSB4X, ACTB, FTL, CLU, PF4, F13A1, GNAS, SPARC, PTMA, TAGLN2, OAZ1 and OST4 demonstrated the highest expression in the analysed cohort, remaining substantial transcription consistency. CSF3R gene was found upregulated in males (fold change 2.10, FDR q < 0.05). Cohort dichotomisation according to the median age, showed upregulated KSR1 in the older donors (fold change 2.11, FDR q < 0.05). Unsupervised hierarchical clustering revealed two clusters which were irrespective of age, sex, storage time, collecting unit or library size. However, when donors are analysed globally (as vectors), sex, storage time, library size, the unit of blood collection as well as age impose a certain degree of between- and/or within-group variability. Healthy donor platelet transcriptome retains general consistency, with very few splice variants deviating from the landscape. Although multidimensional analysis reveals statistically significant variability between and within the analysed groups, biologically, these changes are minor and irrelevant while considering disease classification.

Yet, limited data exist to show the relationship between ctDNA dynamics and tumor genome and immune microenvironment in patients receiving ICB. Here, we present an in-depth analysis of clinical, whole-exome, transcriptome, and ctDNA profiles of 73 patients with advanced solid tumors, across 30 cancer types, from a phase II basket clinical trial of pembrolizumab (NCT02644369) and report changes in genomic and immune landscapes (primary outcomes). Patients stratified by ctDNA and tumor burden dynamics correspond with survival and clinical benefit. High mutation burden, high expression of immune signatures, and mutations in BRCA2 are associated with pembrolizumab molecular sensitivity, while abundant copy-number alterations and B2M loss-of-heterozygosity corresponded with resistance. Upon treatment, induction of genes expressed by T cell, B cell, and myeloid cell populations are consistent with sensitivity and resistance. We identified the upregulated expression of PLA2G2D, an immune-regulating phospholipase, as a potential biomarker of adaptive resistance to ICB. Together, these findings provide insights into the diversity of immunogenomic mechanisms that underpin pembrolizumab outcomes.","2041-1723","Nature communications","(12) 5137",2021,"S Y","Cindy Yang","SY","Department of Medical Biophysics, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada."

This retrospective study elucidates the currently unknown genetic background of a large clinically well-annotated cohort of DLBCL with osseous localizations (O-DLBCL), including PB-DLBCL. A total of 103 patients with O-DLBCL were included and compared with 63 (extra)nodal non-osseous (NO)-DLBCLs with germinal center B-cell phenotype (NO-DLBCL-GCB). Cell-of-origin was determined by immunohistochemistry and gene-expression profiling (GEP) using (extended)-NanoString/Lymph2Cx analysis. Mutational profiles were identified with targeted next-generation deep sequencing, including 52 B-cell lymphoma-relevant genes. O-DLBCLs, including 34 PB-DLBCLs, were predominantly classified as GCB phenotype based on immunohistochemistry (74%) and NanoString analysis (88%). Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of an extended-NanoString/Lymph2Cx revealed significantly different GEP clusters for PB-DLBCL as opposed to NO-DLBCL-GCB (P < .001). Expression levels of 23 genes of 2 different targeted GEP panels indicated a centrocyte-like phenotype for PB-DLBCL, whereas NO-DLBCL-GCB exhibited a centroblast-like constitution. PB-DLBCL had significantly more frequent mutations in four GCB-associated genes (ie, B2M, EZH2, IRF8, TNFRSF14) compared with NO-DLBCL-GCB (P = .031, P = .010, P = .047, and P = .003, respectively). PB-DLBCL, with its corresponding specific mutational profile, was significantly associated with a superior survival compared with equivalent Ann Arbor limited-stage I/II NO-DLBCL-GCB (P = .016). This study is the first to show that PB-DLBCL is characterized by a GCB phenotype, with a centrocyte-like GEP pattern and a GCB-associated mutational profile (both involved in immune surveillance) and a favorable prognosis. These novel biology-associated features provide evidence that PB-DLBCL represents a distinct extranodal DLBCL entity, and its specific mutational landscape offers potential for targeted therapies (eg, EZH2 inhibitors).","2473-9537","Blood advances","(5) 3760-3775",2021,"Ruben A L","de Groen","RAL","Department of Hematology."

Specifically, this reference gene screening was targeted at standardization of gene expression in different tissues (liver, muscle, brain, intestine, heart, eye, skin, and spleen) or under different nutritional conditions (starvation and different dietary lipid levels). Eight candidate reference genes (ribosomal protein L19 and L13 (RPL19 and RPL13), elongation factor-1 alpha (EF1α), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase1 (HPRT1), beta-2-Microglobulin (B2M), 18S ribosomal RNA (18SrRNA), and beta actin (ACTB)) were evaluated with four algorithms (geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, and comparative ΔCt method). The results showed that different algorithms generated inconsistent results. Based on these findings, RPL19, EF1α, 18SrRNA, and RPL13 were relatively stable in different tissues of tiger puffer. During starvation conditions, ACTB/RPL19 was the best reference gene combination. Under different dietary lipid levels, ACTB/RPL13 was the most suitable reference gene combination.

Targeting the pro-metastatic immune cell in the ccRCC microenvironment could provide a solution to this problem. In this study, B cells in ccRCC biopsies were identified by using scRNA-seq and flow cytometry. The findings indicated the presence of a pro-metastatic B cell type which could be further classified into 3 subpopulations, MARCH3, B2M and DTWD1, based on their large-scaled genetic profiles, rather than traditional Immature/Mature ones. Although all of the 3 subpopulations appeared to contribute to distant metastasis, B cell (B2M) was deemed to be the most essential. Moreover, STX16, CLASRP, ATIC, ACIN1 and SEMA4B, were genes found to be commonly up-regulated in the 3 subpopulations and this was correlated to a poor prognosis of ccRCC. Furthermore, the heterogeneity of plasma cells in ccRCC was also found to contribute to metastasis of the disease.

We investigated mitochondrial DNA copy number (mtDNAcn) levels in patients with BD being in manic, depressive or euthymic phase and in healthy controls (HC) both characterized for the levels of blood-based inflammatory markers and stigma of pathogens. 312 patients with BD were compared to 180 HC. mtDNAcn were measured using a digital droplet PCR. Serum levels of 14 inflammatory molecules and 3 anti-infectious IgG stigma were respectively evaluated by electro-chemiluminescence, ELISA and dedicated immunoassays. The statistical analyses were performed using Spearman's correlation, Wilcoxon signed-rank and Kruskal-Wallis rank sum tests. P-values were adjusted for multiple testing with Benjamini-Hochberg method. We found low levels of mtDNAcn in BD patients as compared to HC (P = 0.008) especially during manic episodes (P = 0.0002). We also observed that low levels of mtDNAcn are negatively correlated with mood and psychotic scales (PANSS, YMRS and CGI) (adjusted P (Adj P) = 0.02, 0.003 and 0.05 respectively) and positively with the GAF severity scale (Adj P = 0.002).

The diagnosis requires the presence of a monoclonal IgM component and bone marrow lymphoid infiltration must be demonstrated.

Although the clinical picture is highly heterogeneous, the diagnosis is much easier today compared to the past, since now we can demonstrate the presence of somatic mutations, especially the L265P mutation in the MYD88 gene, highly characteristic of WM (>90% of the patients), followed by the WHIM-like mutations in the CXCR4 gene (~35%). The identification of these mutations is very important, because they can modulate the response to new treatments with Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitors. Thus, the conventional prognostic factors that predict the outcome of these patients (anemia, thrombopenia, high M component, high B2M, and advanced age), must be complemented with the genetic evaluation of the patient, that can help us in the prediction of the risk of transformation from asymptomatic to symptomatic forms (Del6q) and/or from indolent forms of the disease to aggressive lymphomas (CD79b mutations).","1179-2736","Journal of blood medicine","(12) 795-807",2021,"Elham","Askari","E","Hematology Department, Fundación Jiménez Díaz, Centro de Investigación Biomédica en Red-Cáncer (CIBERONC) CB16/12/00369, Madrid, Spain."

We performed a pooled analysis of 13 randomized clinical trials of patients with FL in the pre- and postrituximab eras to identify clinical factors that predict POD24. Logistic regression models evaluated the association between clinical factors and POD24. Cox regression evaluated the association between POD24 as a time-dependent factor and subsequent overall survival (OS). A landmark analysis evaluated the association of POD24 with OS for the subset of patients who were alive at 24 months after trial registration. Patients without progression at 24 months at baseline had favorable performance status (PS), limited-stage (I/II) disease, low-risk FL International Prognostic Index (FLIPI) score, normal baseline hemoglobin, and normal baseline β2 microglobulin (B2M) level.

The established iPSC line, MUSIi001-A-1, can serve as an in vitro model for studying immunological responses against allogeneic grafts and provides a prototype for ""off-the-shelf"" allogeneic cell products for future cell-based therapy.","1876-7753","Stem cell research","(56) 102551",2021,"Nontaphat","Thongsin","N","Siriraj Center for Regenerative Medicine, Research Department, Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand; Department of Immunology, Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand."
34645909,"Targeted clearance of senescent cells using an antibody-drug conjugate against a specific membrane marker.","A wide range of diseases have been shown to be influenced by the accumulation of senescent cells, from fibrosis to diabetes, cancer, Alzheimer's and other age-related pathologies. Consistent with this, clearance of senescent cells can prolong healthspan and lifespan in in vivo models. This provided a rationale for developing a new class of drugs, called senolytics, designed to selectively eliminate senescent cells in human tissues. The senolytics tested so far lack specificity and have significant off-target effects, suggesting that a targeted approach could be more clinically relevant. Here, we propose to use an extracellular epitope of B2M, a recently identified membrane marker of senescence, as a target for the specific delivery of toxic drugs into senescent cells. We show that an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) against B2M clears senescent cells by releasing duocarmycin into them, while an isotype control ADC was not toxic for these cells. This effect was dependent on p53 expression and therefore more evident in stress-induced senescence. Non-senescent cells were not affected by either antibody, confirming the specificity of the treatment. Our results provide a proof-of-principle assessment of a novel approach for the specific elimination of senescent cells using a second generation targeted senolytic against proteins of their surfaceome, which could have clinical applications in pathological ageing and associated diseases.","2045-2322","Scientific reports","(11) 20358",2021,"Marta","Poblocka","M","Mechanisms of Cancer and Aging Laboratory, Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of Leicester, University Road, Leicester, LE1 7RH, UK."

34752497,"Uncovering the stability status of the reputed reference genes in breast and hepatic cancer cell lines.","Accurate and reliable relative gene expression analysis via the Reverse Transcription-quantitative Real Time PCR (RT-qPCR) method strongly depends on employing several stable reference genes as normalizers. Utilization of the reference genes without analyzing their expression stability under each experimental condition causes RT-qPCR analysis error as well as false output. Similar to cancerous tissues, cancer cell lines also exhibit various gene expression profiles. It is crucial to recognize stable reference genes for well-known cancer cell lines to minimize RT-qPCR analysis error. In this study, we showed the expression level and investigated the expression stability of eight common reference genes that are ACTB, YWHAZ, HPRT1, RNA18S, TBP, GAPDH, UBC, and B2M, in two sets of cancerous cell lines. One set contains MCF7, SKBR3, and MDA-MB231 as breast cancer cell lines. Another set includes three hepatic cancer cell lines, including Huh7, HepG2, and PLC-PRF5. Three excel-based softwares comprising geNorm, BestKeeper, and NormFinder, and an online tool, namely RefFinder were used for stability analysis. Although all four algorithms did not show the same stability ranking of nominee genes, the overall results showed B2M and ACTB as the least stable reference genes for the studied breast cancer cell lines. While TBP had the lowest expression stability in the three hepatic cancer cell lines. Moreover, YWHAZ, UBC, and GAPDH showed the highest stability in breast cancer cell lines. Besides that, a panel of five nominees, including ACTB, HPRT1, UBC, YWHAZ, and B2M showed higher stability than others in hepatic cancer cell lines. We believe that our results would help researchers to find and to select the best combination of the reference genes for their own experiments involving the studied breast and hepatic cancer cell lines. To further analyze the reference genes stability for each experimental condition, we suggest researchers to consider the provided stability ranking emphasizing the unstable reference genes.","1932-6203","PloS one","(16) e0259669",2021,"Gilar","Gorji-Bahri","G","Department of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, School of Pharmacy, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."
34861601,"Identification of best housekeeping genes for the normalization of RT-qPCR in human cell lines.","The identification of the best reference gene is a critical step to evaluate the relative change in mRNA expression of a target gene by RT-qPCR. In this work, we evaluated nineteen genes of different functional classes using Real Time Human Reference Gene Panel (Roche Applied Sciences), to identify the internal housekeeping genes (HKGs) most suitable for gene expression normalization data in human cell lines. Normal cell lines CCD-19LU (lung fibroblast), HEK-293 (epithelial cell of embryonic kidney), WI-26 VA4 (lung fibroblast), and human cancer cells, BT-549 (breast cancer), Hs 578T (breast cancer), MACL-1 (breast cancer), HeLa (cervical carcinoma), U-87 MG (glioblastoma/astrocytoma), RKO-AS45-1 (colorectal carcinoma), and TOV-21G (ovarian adenocarcinoma) were cultivated according to manufacturer's protocol. Twelve candidate reference genes were commonly expressed in five cell lines (CCD-19Lu, HEK-293, RKO-AS45-1, TOV-21G, and U-87 MG). To verify the expression stability, we used the RefFinder web tool, which integrates data from the computational programs Normfinder, BestKeeper, geNorm, and the comparative Delta-Ct method. The ACTB was the most stable reference gene to the CCD-19Lu and HEK-293 cells. The best combination of HKGs for the RKO-AS45-1 and TOV-21G cell lines were B2M/GAPDH and PBGD/B2M, respectively. For the U-87 MG cells, GAPDH and IPO8 were the most suitable HKGs. Thus, our findings showed that it is crucial to use the right HKGs to precise normalize gene expression levels in cancer studies, once a suitable HKG for one cell type cannot be to the other.","1618-0372","Acta histochemica","(124) 151821",2022,"Leticia","da Conceição Braga","L","Cellular Biology, Research and Development Department, Ezequiel Dias Foundation, Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais 30510-010, Brazil; Translacional Research Laboratory, Mário Penna Institute, Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais 31270-901, Brazil."

The main reasons for their extensive use are their plasticity and multiple applications, including in regenerative medicine and the screening of new drugs. The aim of this study was to better understand these structures by focusing on the choice of the best housekeeping gene (HKG) to perform accurate molecular analysis on such a heterogeneous system. This feature should not be underestimated because the inappropriate use of a HKG can lead to misleading data and incorrect results, especially when the subject of the study is innovative and not totally explored like organoids. We focused our attention on the newly described human pancreatic organoids (hPOs) and compared 12 well-known HKGs (ACTB, B2M, EF1α, GAPDH, GUSB, HPRT, PPIA, RNA18S, RPL13A TBP, UBC and YWHAZ). Four different statistical algorithms (NormFinder, geNorm, BestKeeper and ΔCt) were applied to estimate the expression stability of each HKG, and RefFinder was used to identify the most suitable genes for RT-qPCR data normalization. Our results showed that the intragroup and intergroup comparisons could influence the best choice of the HKG, making clear that the identification of a stable reference gene for accurate and reproducible RT-qPCR data normalization remains a critical issue. In summary, this is the first report on HKGs in human organoids, and this work provides a strong basis to pave the way for further gene analysis in hPOs.","1932-6203","PloS one","(16) e0260902",2021,"Alessandro","Cherubini","A","Department of Transfusion Medicine and Haematology, Laboratory of Regenerative Medicine-Cell Factory, Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milan, Italy."

Convergent findings show that inflammation could contribute to resistance. We thus search for immune signatures of patients with TRS/ultra TRS (UTRS) in a sample of community-dwelling outpatients with SZ. In total, 195 stabilized SZ patients (mean age = 31.2 years, 73% male gender) were consecutively included in the network of the FondaMental Expert Centers for Schizophrenia in France and received a thorough clinical assessment. At inclusion, psychotic symptomatology was evaluated by the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) for schizophrenia. Circulating serum/plasma levels of a large panel of markers reflecting the main inflammatory pathways were evaluated. TRS was defined by current treatment by clozapine (CLZ) and UTRS by current CLZ treatment + PANSS total score ≥ 70. The frequency of TRS and UTRS patients was, respectively, 20% and 7.7% and was defined using multivariable analysis elevated by high levels of interleukin (IL)-12/IL-23p40, IL-17A, IL-10, and beta 2 microglobulin (B2M) and IL-12/IL-23p40, IL-17A, IL-6, IL-10, IFNγ, and B2M, respectively. These observations suggest that resistance and ultra resistance to CLZ treatment are underpinned by pro-inflammatory molecules mainly belonging to the T helper 17 pathway, a finding making sense given the interplay between inflammation and antipsychotic treatment responses. If confirmed, our findings may allow us to consider IL-23/IL-17 pathway as a therapeutic target for patients with resistance to antipsychotics.","2632-7899","Schizophrenia bulletin open","(2) sgab012",2021,"Marion","Leboyer","M","Univ Paris Est Créteil, INSERM, IMRB, Translational Neuropsychiatry, DMU IMPACT, Fondation FondaMental, F-94010, Créteil, France."

Here, we aimed to identify novel biomarkers for advanced NTG by analyzing the proteome of patient-derived AH and their correlation with various functional and structural parameters from the visual field test (VF), optical coherence tomography (OCT), and OCT angiography (OCTA). We determined differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) of the AH of patients with advanced NTG (n = 20) using label-free quantitative (LFQ) proteomics with pooled samples and data-independent acquisition (DIA) analysis with individual samples, and the roles of AH DEPs in biological pathways were evaluated using bioinformatics. We identified 603 proteins in the AH of patients with advanced NTG, and 61 of them were selected as DEPs via global proteome LFQ profiling. Individual DIA analyses identified a total of 12 DEPs as biomarker candidates, seven of which were upregulated, and five were downregulated. Gene ontology enrichment analysis revealed that those DEPs were mainly involved in the immune response. Moreover, IGFBP2, ENO1, C7, B2M, AMBP, DSP, and DCD showed a significant correlation with the mean deviation of VF and with peripapillary and macular parameters from OCT and OCTA.

In a previous analysis of 12 human samples we identified two challenges to measuring gene expression from total RNA: (1) the fraction of human RNA in whole saliva was low and (2) the bacterial contamination was overwhelming. To overcome these challenges, we performed selective cDNA synthesis for human RNA species only by employing poly(A)+-tail primers followed by qRT-PCR. In the current study, this approach was independently validated on 91 samples from 61 healthy donors. Additionally, we used the ratio of human to bacterial RNA to adjust the input RNA to include equal amounts of human RNA across all samples before cDNA synthesis, which then ensured comparable analysis using the same base human input material. Furthermore, we examined relative levels of ten known housekeeping genes, and assessed inter- and intra-individual differences in 61 salivary RNA isolates, while considering effects of demographical factors (e.g. sex, age), epidemiological factors comprising social habits (e.g. alcohol, cigarette consumption), oral hygiene (e.g. flossing, mouthwash), previous radiological diagnostic procedures (e.g. number of CT-scans) and saliva collection time (circadian periodic). Total human RNA amounts appeared significantly associated with age only (P ≤ 0.02). None of the chosen housekeeping genes showed significant circadian periodicity and either did not associate or were weakly associated with the 24 confounders examined, with one exception, 60% of genes were altered by mouthwash. ATP6, ACTB and B2M represented genes with the highest mean baseline expression (Ct-values ≤ 30) and were detected in all samples. Combining these housekeeping genes for normalization purposes did not decrease inter-individual variance, but increased the robustness.

Transcriptional profiling of islets treated with IFN-α was explored by RNA-seq. IFN-α induced antigen presentation was evaluated by qRT-PCR, western blot and immunofluorescence, and key transcription factors were inhibited by small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). Our data show that IFN-α contributed to the progression of autoimmune insulitis in NOD mice by promoting the proliferation of CD8+ T cells. IFN-α upregulated antigen presentation related genes MHC I, TAP1, B2M, PSMB8, NLRC5 and transcriptional regulator STAT1, STAT2, IRF7 at a time and dose-dependent manner. The silence of STAT1 or STAT2 both weakened IFN-α-induced increase of antigen presenting related molecules. IRF7 was also merely influenced by STAT1 silence.

After analyzing the response to anti-PD-1 therapy in these 110 patients, we found similar results (P=0.438 and 0.071, respectively). Moreover, patients with B2M or JAK1/2 mutation had a lower tumor mutational burden score compared with those without. B2M and JAK1/2 loss-of-function mutations occur frequently in microsatellite instability-high CRC. Our study demonstrated that patients with CRC harboring B2M or JAK1/2 mutations should not be excluded from anti-PD-1 therapy.","1537-4513","Journal of immunotherapy (Hagerstown, Md. : 1997)","(45) 187-193",2022,"Chenzhi","Zhang","C","Departments of Colorectal Surgery."
35368100,"A novel clinical immune-related prognostic model predicts the overall survival of mantle cell lymphoma.","The mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) International Prognostic Index (MIPI) and combined MIPI (MIPI-c) are commonly used for risk classification of MCL patients. However, these indexes lack immune-related parameters. The purpose of this study was to develop a novel prognostic model that integrated clinical and immune parameters. A total of 189 patients with newly diagnosed MCL from January 2010 to June 2020 were enrolled in our study. A nomogram and immune-related prognostic index (IRPI) were established to predict the overall survival (OS) of patients according to univariate and multivariate analyses. Discrimination and calibration were used to compare the prognostic performance of the IRPI, MIPI, and MIPI-c. External validation was performed based on validation dataset (n = 150) from two other centers. The results for the training dataset indicated that B symptoms, platelet count, B2M level, CD4+ T-cell count<26.7% and CD8+ T-cell count>44.2% were predictors for OS. All the prognostic factors were integrated into the nomogram. For the overlap of confidence intervals of each variable, we assigned one point for each factor. The IRPI categorized patients into three risk categories: a score of zero indicated low risk, a score of one or two indicated intermediate risk, and a score of ≥3 indicated high risk. The IRPI showed better discrimination and calibration power than the MIPI and MIPI-c in the training dataset and validation dataset. The novel IRPI is a refined risk stratification index and reflects the strong complementary prognostic effects between clinical and immune parameters in MCL.","1099-1069","Hematological oncology","(40) 343-355",2022,"Huijuan","Lv","H","Department of Lymphoma, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, National Clinical Research Center for Cancer, Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Therapy, Tianjin's Clinical Research Center for Cancer, Sino-US Center for Lymphoma and Leukemia Research, Tianjin, China."

Following the loss of the peptide and the light chain beta-2 microglobulin (β2m, encoded by B2M), the resulting free heavy chains (FHCs) can associate into homotypic complexes in the plasma membrane. Here, we investigate the stoichiometry and dynamics of MHC-I FHCs assemblies by combining a micropattern assay with fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) and with single-molecule co-tracking. We identify non-covalent MHC-I FHC dimers, with dimerization mediated by the α3 domain, as the prevalent species at the plasma membrane, leading a moderate decrease in the diffusion coefficient. MHC-I FHC dimers show increased tendency to cluster into higher order oligomers as concluded from an increased immobile fraction with higher single-molecule colocalization. In vitro studies with isolated proteins in conjunction with molecular docking and dynamics simulations suggest that in the complexes, the α3 domain of one FHC binds to another FHC in a manner similar to that seen for β2m.","1477-9137","Journal of cell science","jcs259489",2022,"Cindy","Dirscherl","C","School of Science, Jacobs University Bremen, 28759 Bremen, Germany."

This study aims to identify stable reference genes for analyzing the expression of proliferation-related and differentiation-inducing genes in bovine primary preadipocytes (BPPs) in vitro. In this study, the stability of 16 candidate internal reference genes (GAPDH, ACTB, PPIA, LRP10, HPRT1, YWHAZ, B2M, TBP, EIF3K, RPS9, UXT, 18S rRNA, RPLP0, MARVELD, EMD and RPS15A) for qRT-PCR at proliferation and differentiation stages of BPPs was investigated by three different algorithms (geNorm, NormFinder and BestKeeper). The expression of two marker genes, PCNA and LPL, was used to determine the validity of the candidate reference genes (RGs) at the proliferation and differentiation stages, respectively. The results showed that GAPDH and RPS15A were the most stable RGs in the proliferation of bovine primary preadipocyte, while PPIA was the least stable internal reference gene.

To better elucidate the genetic basis of DM, we analysed the circRNA and mRNA expression profiles in serum samples from diabetic patients. The circRNAs and mRNAs with abnormal expression in the DM group and non-diabetic group (NDM) were classified by RNA sequencing and differential expression analysis. The circRNA-miRNA-mRNA regulatory network reveals the mechanism by which competitive endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) regulate gene expression. The biological functions and interactions of circRNA and mRNA were analysed by gene ontology (GO) enrichment and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis. Differential expression analysis showed that 441 circRNAs (366 up-regulated, 75 down-regulated) and 683 mRNAs (354 up-regulated, 329 down-regulated) were significantly differentially expressed in the DM group compared with the NDM group. Screening of the differential genes at the nodes of the interaction network showed that a single circRNA could interact with multiple miRNAs and then jointly regulate more mRNAs. In addition, the expressions of circRNA CNOT6 and AXIN1 as well as mRNA STAT3, MYD88, and B2M were associated with the progression of diabetes. Enrichment pathway analysis indicated that differentially expressed circRNA and mRNA may participate in Nod-like receptor signalling pathway, insulin signalling pathway, sphinolipid metabolism pathway, and ribosome pathway, and play a role in the pathogenesis of diabetes. This study provides a theoretical basis for elucidating the molecular mechanism of DM occurrence and development at circRNA and mRNA levels.","1742-481X","International wound journal","(19) 1253-1262",2022,"Wanni","Zhao","W","Department of Gastrointestinal Surgery/Clinical Nutrition, Key Laboratory of Cancer FSMP for State Market Regulation, Beijing Shijitan Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China."

We discovered a unique copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity (CN-LOH) landscape of PMBL which distinguishes this tumor from other B-cell malignancies, including the biologically related diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Using single nucleotide polymorphism array analysis we identified large-scale CN-LOH lesions in 91% (30/33) of diagnostic PMBLs and both investigated PMBL-derived cell lines. Altogether, the cohort showed 157 extra-large (25.3-248.4 Mb) CN-LOH lesions affecting up to 14 chromosomes per case (mean of 4.4) and resulting in a reduction of heterozygosity an average of 9.9% (range 1.3-51%) of the genome. Predominant involvement of terminal chromosomal segments suggests the implication of B-cell specific crossover events in the pathogenesis of PMBL. Notably, CN-LOH stretches non-randomly clustered on 6p (60%), 15 (37.2%), and 17q (40%), and frequently co-occurred with homozygous mutations in the MHC I (6p21), B2M (15q15), and GNA13 (17q23) genes, respectively, as shown by preliminary whole-exome/genome sequencing data. Altogether, our findings implicate CN-LOH as a novel and distinct mutational process contributing to the molecular pathogenesis of PMBL. The aberration acting as ""second hit"" in the Knudson hypothesis, ranks as the major mechanism converting to homozygosity the PMBL-related driver genes.

35689945,"ECM proteins involved in cell migration and vessel formation compromise bovine cloned placentation.","Advances in Artificial Reproductive Technologies (ARTs) in bovine embryos to produce cloned pregnancies have been developed in the last years, however high pregnancy losses rates still present. Those rates are associated to placental morphology alterations that are majorly focused on extracellular matrix (ECM) alterations and consequently placentome hyperplasia, increased trophoblast cell migration and vascular defects. Herein, we aimed to search, at protein level, pathways altered by ART that can modify the placental development harmony. For this, we used 4-month-old control (n = 3), SDS-decellularized (n = 3) and cloned (n = 3) cotyledons for proteomic analysis. Samples were grouped by condition and were washed, lysed, urea-reduced, acetone-precipitated, DTT-educed, iodoacetamide-alkylated, trypsin digested, and C-18 column purified. At the end, 3 μg protein were loaded in Orbitrap Fusion Lumos spectrometer (ThermoScientific). Generated spectra were exported to MaxQuant software (v1.6.10.43) to produce the protein list of each sample, and the LFQ intensity were statistically analyzed by Inferno software (v.1.1.6970). After this, proteins related to ECM and cellular junction ontologies were filtered and manually annotated using DAVID Bioinformatics Resources 6.8. From 2577 identified protein sequences by MaxQuant software, 165 (7.1%) were filtered by selected ontologies. We found 10 proteins (B2M, COL6A6, FERMT3, LGALS3BP, NIBAN2, PDLIM5, PON1, PRP9, RASIP1 and SPARC) upregulated in clone, when compared to control condition. The ten pathways that enriched more proteins were: focal adhesion, ECM-receptor interaction, PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, protein digestion and absorption, amoebiasis, pathways in cancer, small cell lung cancer, platelet activation, regulation of actin cytoskeleton, and proteoglycans in cancer. Functionally, detected proteins, signaling pathways and ontologies are orchestrated to permit the binucleated trophoblastic cells migration and blood vessels modelling. In conclusion, the cloned condition presents the same mechanisms as control one, however overexpression of some specific ECM proteins could be responsible to exacerbate those mechanisms and can explain all morphophysiological alterations presented in cloned pregnancies associated to high pregnancies losses rates in this condition.","1879-3231","Theriogenology","(188) 156-162",2022,"Rodrigo da Silva Nunes","Barreto","RDSN","Department of Surgery, School of Veterinary Medicine and Animal Science, University of São Paulo, Ave. Prof. Dr. Orlando Marques Paiva, 87, CEP 05508-270, São Paulo, Brazil."

We aim to explore the associations of phthalates and hypertension with early renal injury, and the interactive effects of phthalate and hypertension on the early renal injury. This study enrolled 3283 U.S. adults from NHANES 2001-2004. We detected nine phthalate metabolites in spot urine. We also measured the multiple indicators of early renal injury, including albumin-to-creatinine (Cr) ratio (ACR), β2-microglobulin (B2M), cystatin C (CYST), and calculated the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), including Cr-based eGFR, CYST-based eGFR, and Cr-CYST-based eGFR. Multiple linear regression and multivariable logistic regression were used to explore the associations among urinary phthalate metabolites, hypertension, and the indicators of early renal injury. The results showed that monobenzyl phthalate (MBzP), mono (3-carboxypropyl) phthalate (MCPP), and mono (2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP) were positively associated with ACR, B2M, CYST and negatively associated with three eGFR. Mono(2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl) phthalate (MEOHP) was positively associated with ACR, with a β value of 0.099 (95% CI: 0.046, 0.152). Meanwhile, MEHP was associated with a higher risk of ACR abnormality, with an OR value of 1.258 (95% CI: 1.067, 1.482). MBzP, MCPP, and MEOHP increased the risks of ACR, B2M, CYST, and eGFR abnormality. Hypertension was positively associated with ACR, with a β value of 0.460 (95% CI: 0.360, 0.561). We also found interactive effects of monoethyl phthalate (MEP), MCPP, MBzP, monobutyl phthalate (MnBP), and hypertension on B2M, CYST, and three kinds of eGFR. Our results indicated that certain phthalate metabolites might contribute to increased risks of early renal injury.

The etiology of the disease is still partially unknown. This study focuses on understanding the genetic mechanisms potentially underlying endometrosis in mares using the Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technique. Endometrial samples, used in the study, were obtained in the anestrus phase both from healthy mares and those diagnosed with endometrosis. The NGS data were analyzed for gene involvement in biological processes and pathways (e.g. STAR, KOBAS-I, STRING, and ClustVis software). Bioinformatic analysis revealed differential expression of 55 transcripts. In tissues with endometrosis, most genes displayed upregulated expression. The protein-protein interaction analysis disclosed a substantial transcript network including transcripts related to metabolism e.g. sulfur metabolism (SELENBP1), ovarian steroidogenesis, steroid hormone biosynthesis, and chemical carcinogenesis (CYP1B1), COXs (COX4I1, COX3, UQCRFS1) as well as transcripts related to immune response e.g. MMP7, JCHAIN, PIGR, CALR, B2M, FCGRT. Interestingly, the latter has been previously linked with various pathologies including cancers in the female reproductive system. In conclusion, this study evaluated genes that are not directly impacted by sex hormone feedback, but that create a metabolic and immune environment in tissues, thus influencing fertility and pregnancy in mares with endometrosis. Moreover, some of the identified genes may be implicated in tumorigenesis of endometrial lesions. These data may be useful as a starting point in further research, such as the development of targeted strategies for rapid diagnosis and/or prevention of this pathology based on gene and protein-protein interactions.","1879-3231","Theriogenology","(189) 158-166",2022,"M","Witkowski","M","Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology with Andrology and Animal Reproduction Biotechnology, University Centre of Veterinary Medicine JU-UA, University of Agriculture in Krakow, Mickiewicza 24/28, 30-059, Krakow, Poland; Equine Hospital on the Racing Truck, Sluzewiec, Pulawska 266, 02-684, Warszawa, Poland."

B2M activated PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling by interacting with PIP5K1A in GBM stem cells (GSC) and promoting MYC-induced secretion of transforming growth factor-β1 (TGFβ1). Inhibition of B2M attenuated GSC survival, self-renewal, and tumor growth. B2M-induced TGFβ1 secretion activated paracrine SMAD and PI3K/AKT signaling in TAMs and promoted an M2-like macrophage phenotype.

35843191,"A decreased expression of interferon stimulated genes in peri-implantation endometrium of embryo transfer recipient sows could contribute to embryo death.","Pig pregnancy succeeds thanks to a well-coordinated system ruling both maternal immune activation and embryonic antigen tolerance. In physiological pregnancies, the maternal immune system should tolerate the presence of hemi-allogeneic conceptuses from the pre-implantation phase to term, while maintaining maternal defence against pathogens. Allogeneic pregnancies, as after embryo transfer (ET), depict high embryo mortality during the attachment phase, calling for studies of the dynamic modifications in immune processes occurring at the maternal-foetal interface, for instance, of interferon (IFN)-stimulated genes (ISGs). These ISGs are generally activated by IFN secreted by the conceptus during the process of maternal recognition of pregnancy (MRP) and responsible for recruiting immune cells to the site of embryo attachment, thus facilitating cell-antigen presentation and angiogenesis. We performed RNA-Seq analysis in peri-implantation (days 18 and 24) endometrial samples retrieved from artificially inseminated sows (hemi-allogeneic embryos (HAL) group) or sows subjected to ET (allogeneic embryos (AL) group) to monitor alterations of gene expression that could be jeopardising early pregnancy. Our results showed that endometrial gene expression patterns related to immune responses differed between hemi- or allogeneic embryo presence, with allogeneic embryos apparently inducing conspicuous modifications of immune-related genes and pathways. A decreased expression (P < 0.05; FC < -2) of several interferon ISGs, such as CXCL8, CXCL10, IRF1, IRF9, STAT1, and B2M, among others was detected in the endometrium of sows carrying allogeneic embryos on day 24 of pregnancy. This severe downregulation of ISGs in allogeneic pregnancies could represent a failure of ET-embryos to signal IFN to the endometrium to warrant the development of adequate immunotolerance mechanisms to facilitate embryo development, thus contributing to elevated embryo death.","1751-732X","Animal : an international journal of animal bioscience","(16) 100590",2022,"C A","Martinez","CA","Department of Biomedical & Clinical Sciences (BKV), BKH/Obstetrics & Gynaecology, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Linköping University, SE-58185 Linköping, Sweden.

We found consecutive acquisition of beta-2 microglobulin (B2M) loss and impaired Janus kinase 1 (JAK1) signaling that coexisted in progressing tumor cells. Functional analyses revealed a pan T-cell immune escape phenotype, where distinct alterations mediated independent immune resistance to tumor killing by autologous CD8+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL; B2M loss) and CD4+ TILs (impaired JAK1 signaling). These findings shed light on the complexity of acquired resistance to immunotherapy in the post anti-PD-1 setting, indicating that coexisting altered pathways can lead to pan T-cell immune escape.","2326-6074","Cancer immunology research","(10) 1254-1262",2022,"Morten","Nielsen","M","National Center for Cancer Immune Therapy, Department of Oncology, Copenhagen University Hospital, Herlev, Denmark."

Posttransplant immune incompetence exposes patients to disease relapse and infections. We previously demonstrated that donor alloreactive natural killer (NK) cells ablate recipient hematopoietic targets, including leukemia. Here, in murine models, we show that infusion of donor alloreactive NK cells triggers recipient dendritic cells (DCs) to synthesize β-2-microglobulin (B2M) that elicits the release of c-KIT ligand and interleukin-7 that greatly accelerate posttransplant immune reconstitution. An identical chain of events was reproduced by infusing supernatants of alloreactive NK/DC cocultures. Similarly, human alloreactive NK cells triggered human DCs to synthesize B2M that induced interleukin-7 production by thymic epithelial cells and thereby supported thymocyte cellularity in vitro. Chromatography fractionation of murine and human alloreactive NK/DC coculture supernatants identified a protein with molecular weight and isoelectric point of B2M, and mass spectrometry identified amino acid sequences specific of B2M. Anti-B2M antibody depletion of NK/DC coculture supernatants abrogated their immune-rebuilding effect. B2M knock-out mice were unable to undergo accelerated immune reconstitution, but infusion of (wild-type) NK/DC coculture supernatants restored their ability to undergo accelerated immune reconstitution. Similarly, silencing the B2M gene in human DCs, before coculture with alloreactive NK cells, prevented the increase in thymocyte cellularity in vitro. Finally, human recombinant B2M increased thymocyte cellularity in a thymic epithelial cells/thymocyte culture system. Our studies uncover a novel therapeutic principle for treating posttransplant immune incompetence and suggest that, upon its translation to the clinic, patients may benefit from adoptive transfer of large numbers of cytokine-activated, ex vivo-expanded donor alloreactive NK cells.","1528-0020","Blood","(140) 2323-2334",2022,"Loredana","Ruggeri","L","Division of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Perugia General Hospital, Perugia, Italy."

These include primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma (PMBL), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), or mediastinal gray-zone lymphoma (MGZL). Such patients are often refractory to standard therapy and their diagnosis is hampered by significant morphologic and immunophenotypic overlap and insufficient molecular data. Among 509 CHL patients seen at an academic medical center, 6 patients had a prior or subsequent diagnosis different from CHL. Paired tissue samples were evaluated by targeted mutational analysis using a 164-gene panel. Our findings show multiple shared variants indicative of a clonal relationship between the CHL and the PMBL, DLBCL, or MGZL diagnoses. Most frequent mutated genes included TNFAIP3 (4 of 6, 66.7%), STAT6 (3 or 6, 50%), ARID1A (3 of 6, 50%), and XPO1 (3 of 5, 60%). Three patients showed the same oncogenic variant within the XPO1 gene (E571K), and mutations in TNFAIP3 and B2M were observed in 2 of the 5 patients with shared variants. In addition, differences in the mutation profile between the lymphoma pairs were also observed, which could represent clonal evolution. Mutational profiling could be of benefit in patients with recurrent/refractory disease with discordant histology, where the clonal relationship could be helpful to inform and guide therapeutic decisions. These findings provide further evidence of a true biological continuum surrounding CHL, PMBL, DLBCL, and MGZL and shed light on underlying genetic events and their clinical impact.","1532-0979","The American journal of surgical pathology","(47) 81-90",2023,"Kunwar","Singh","K","Department of Pathology, Stanford University School of Medicine."

Ιnterferon-gamma (IFN-γ) is a pleiotropic cytokine with antiviral activity that modulates the innate and adaptive immune responses. In this study, we prepared high-purity bovine interferon gamma (BoIFN-γ) dimer protein using prokaryotic expression system and affinity chromatography. We subsequently investigated the effect of BoIFN-γ on BoHV-1 infection in Madin-Darby bovine kidney (MDBK) cells. The results showed that BoIFN-γ pre-treament not only decreased the production of BoHV-1 but also reduced the cytopathic effect of the virus. Differential gene expression profiles of BoHV-1 infected MDBK cells were then analysed through high-throughput RNA sequencing. The data showed that BoIFN-γ pre-treatment reduced lipid metabolism disorder and DNA damage caused by BoHV-1 infection. Furthermore, BoIFN-γ treatment upregulated the transcription of interferon regulatory transcription factors (IRF1 and GBP5) and interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) of MDBK cells. Additionally, BoIFN-γ promotes expression of cellular protein involved in complement activation and coagulation cascades response as well as antigen processing and presentation process, while BoHV-1 infection dramatically downregulates transcription of these immune components including C3, C1r, C1s, PLAT, ITGB2, PROCR, BoLA, CD74, B2M, PA28, BoLA-DRA, and TAPBP. Collectively, our findings revealed that BoIFN-γ pre-treatment can improve host resistance to BoHV-1 infection and regulate transcription or expression of host protein associated with cellular metabolism and innate immune response. This provides insights into the development of prophylactic agents for prevention and control of BoHV-1 infection.","1664-302X","Frontiers in microbiology","(13) 973278",2022,"Bo","Jiang","B","Institute of Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Medicine, Beijing Academy of Agricultural and Forestry Sciences, Beijing, China."

Beta-2-microglobulin (β2M), an important subunit of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I, has important biological functions and roles in tumor immunity. In recent years, increasing studies have shown that B2M gene deficiency can inhibit MHC class I antigen presentation and lead to cancer immune evasion by affecting β2M expression. Based on this, B2M gene defect and T cell-based immunotherapy can interact to affect the efficacy of melanoma treatment.

36092893,"Evolutionary selection identifies critical immune-relevant genes in lung cancer subtypes.","In an evolving population, proliferation is dependent on fitness so that a numerically dominant population typically possesses the most well adapted phenotype. In contrast, the evolutionary ""losers"" typically disappear from the population so that their genetic record is lost. Historically, cancer research has focused on observed genetic mutations in the dominant tumor cell populations which presumably increase fitness. Negative selection, i.e., removal of deleterious mutations from a population, is not observable but can provide critical information regarding genes involved in essential cellular processes. Similar to immunoediting, ""evolutionary triage"" eliminates mutations in tumor cells that increase susceptibility to the host immune response while mutations that shield them from immune attack increase proliferation and are readily observable (e.g., B2M mutations). These dynamics permit an ""inverse problem"" analysis linking the fitness consequences of a mutation to its prevalence in a tumor cohort. This is evident in ""driver mutations"" but, equally important, can identify essential genes in which mutations are seen significantly less than expected by chance. Here we utilized this new approach to investigate evolutionary triage in immune-related genes from TCGA lung adenocarcinoma cohorts. Negative selection differs between the two cohorts and is observed in endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidase genes, ERAP1 and ERAP2 genes, and DNAM-1/TIGIT ligands. Targeting genes or molecular pathways under positive or negative evolutionary selection may permit new treatment options and increase the efficacy of current immunotherapy.","1664-8021","Frontiers in genetics","(13) 921447",2022,"Kimberly A","Luddy","KA","Cancer Biology and Evolution Program, H.

36171416,"Evaluation of candidate reference genes for quantitative real-time PCR normalization in blood from red deer developing antlers.","Sexual selection favors male traits that increase their ability to monopolize the breeding access to several females. Deer antlers are cranial appendages that regenerate annually in males. Throughout life, the phenology of antler growth advances and antler mass increases until the stag reaches, between 8 and 10 years old, maximum body mass and highest reproductive success. The molecular mechanisms of antler development are of great interest in both evolutionary and regenerative medicine studies. To minimize errors in the assessment of gene expression levels by qRT-PCR, we analyzed the stability of a panel of eight candidate reference genes and concluded that qRT-PCR normalization to three stable genes is strongly convenient in experiments performed in red deer antler blood. To validate our proposal, we compared the expression level of three genes linked to red deer antler growth (ANXA2, APOD and TPM1) in fifteen male red deer classified as young (up to 4 years old) and adults (4-6 years old). Our data confirms that B2M, ACTB and RPLP0 are valuable reference genes for future gene expression studies in red deer antler blood, which would provide increased insight into the effects of intrinsic factors that determine antler development in red deer.","2045-2322","Scientific reports","(12) 16264",2022,"Camilla","Broggini","C","Wildlife Research Unit (UIRCP-UCO), University of Cordoba, 14014, Cordoba, Spain. z62brbrc@uco.es."

For the quantification of this and the effect of different factors affecting these processes, the expression levels of various maturation markers are determined using reverse transcription-quantitative PCR. For this purpose, stably expressed reference genes are crucial. However, no studies evaluating the stability of reference genes in THP-1 cells stimulated with LPS and IFN-γ have been performed. Therefore, this paper describes the selection of the most used reference genes [RPL37A (ribosomal protein L37a), GAPDH (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase), UBC (ubiquitin C), B2M (0β2-microbulin), ACTB (β-actin) and PPIA (cyclophilin A)], the in silico primer design, the analysis and the validation of these in accordance with the MIQE (Minimum Information for Publication of Quantitative Real-Time PCR Experiments) guidelines and more recent recommendations for the validation of the stability of reference genes. Using the RefFinder platform, including the four most popular algorithms for reference gene validation, the Delta CT, BestKeeper, NormFinder and geNorm, we find the reference genes GAPDH and UBC to be the most stable. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the normalization of gene expression data using the least stable reference genes, ACTB and B2M, dramatically affects the interpretation of experimental data.

This study aimed to demonstrate the plasma proteomic profiles of NPDR+DKD and NPDR patients and identify potential biomarkers for early diagnosis of DKD. Fifteen plasma samples from the NPDR group and nine from the NPDR+DKD group were analyzed by LC-MS/MS to identify the differentially expressed proteins between the two groups. Functional enrichment, protein-protein interaction and clinical feature correlation analyses revealed the target protein candidates, which were verified using ELISA and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. In total, 410 proteins were detected in plasma; 15 were significantly upregulated and 7 were downregulated in the NPDR+DKD group. Bioinformatics analysis suggested that DKD is closely related to cell adhesion and immunity pathways. β-2-Microglobulin (B2M) and vimentin (VIM) were upregulated in NPDR+DKD, enriched as hub proteins and strongly correlated with clinical features. ELISA showed that B2M (p<0.001) and VIM (p<0.0001) were significantly upregulated in NPDR+DKD compared with NPDR.

However, the identification of suitable reference genes of RT-qPCR for OS cell lines has not been reported. Here, we conducted the normalization research of 12 reference genes (GAPDH, ACTB, 18S, B2M, ALAS1, GUSB, HPRT1, HMBS, PPIA, PUM1, RPL29, and TBP) for gene expression analysis in four kinds of human OS cell lines (U2OS, Saos-2, HOS, and MG-63) to improve the investigation of molecular mechanisms and the accuracy of diagnosis and prognostic molecular targets of OS. The gene expression stability and applicability of the 12 reference gene candidates were determined using geNorm, NormFinder, and BestKeeper software. The results indicated that PUM1 and the combination of PPIA + ALAS1 were recommended as the optimal reference gene in these four different sources of human OS cell lines under proliferative conditions. The present study identified the most suitable reference genes and reference gene combinations for OS cell lines under proliferative conditions in order to use in gene expression profile analysis. A reliable standardized method has the potential to improve the understanding of the biological mechanisms underlying OS in the future.","1664-8021","Frontiers in genetics","(13) 989990",2022,"Xiaoming","Dong","X","Medical Center of Orthopaedics, The Second Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, China."
36574441,"Identification of β2 microglobulin, the product of B2M gene, as a Host Factor for Vaccinia Virus Infection by Genome-Wide CRISPR genetic screens.","Genome-wide genetic screens are powerful tools to identify genes that act as host factors of viruses. We have applied this technique to analyze the infection of HeLa cells by Vaccinia virus, in an attempt to find genes necessary for infection. Infection of cell populations harboring single gene inactivations resulted in no surviving cells, suggesting that no single gene knock-out was able to provide complete resistance to Vaccinia virus and thus allow cells to survive infection. In the absence of an absolute infection blockage, we explored if some gene inactivations could provide partial protection leading to a reduced probability of infection. Multiple experiments using modified screening procedures involving replication restricted viruses led to the identification of multiple genes whose inactivation potentially increase resistance to infection and therefore cell survival. As expected, significant gene hits were related to proteins known to act in virus entry, such as ITGB1 and AXL as well as genes belonging to their downstream related pathways. Additionally, we consistently found β2-microglobulin, encoded by the B2M gene, among the screening top hits, a novel finding that was further explored. Inactivation of B2M resulted in 54% and 91% reduced VV infection efficiency in HeLa and HAP1 cell lines respectively. In the absence of B2M, while virus binding to the cells was unaffected, virus internalization and early gene expression were significantly diminished. These results point to β2-microglobulin as a relevant factor in the Vaccinia virus entry process.","1553-7374","PLoS pathogens","(18) e1010800",2022,"Alejandro","Matía","A","Departamento de Biotecnología, Instituto Nacional de Investigación y Tecnología Agraria y Alimentaria-Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas (INIA-CSIC), Madrid, Spain."
36584049,"In vitro genome editing activity of Cas9 in somatic cells after random and transposon-based genomic Cas9 integration.","Due to its close resemblance, the domesticated pig has proven to be a diverse animal model for biomedical research and genome editing tools have contributed to developing porcine models for several human diseases. By employing the CRISPR-Cas9 system, porcine embryos or somatic cells can be genetically modified to generate the desired genotype. However, somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) of modified somatic cells and embryo manipulation are challenging, especially if the desired genotype is detrimental to the embryo. Direct in vivo edits may facilitate the production of genetically engineered pigs by integrating Cas9 into the porcine genome. Cas9 expressing cells were generated by either random integration or transposon-based integration of Cas9 and used as donor cells in SCNT. In total, 15 animals were generated that carried a transposon-based Cas9 integration and two pigs a randomly integrated Cas9. Cas9 expression was confirmed in muscle, tonsil, spleen, kidney, lymph nodes, oral mucosa, and liver in two boars. Overall, Cas9 expression was higher for transposon-based integration, except in tonsils and liver. To verify Cas9 activity, fibroblasts were subjected to in vitro genome editing. Isolated fibroblasts were transfected with guide RNAs (gRNA) targeting different genes (GGTA1, B4GALNT2, B2M) relevant to xenotransplantation. Next generation sequencing revealed that the editing efficiencies varied (2-60%) between the different target genes. These results show that the integrated Cas9 remained functional, and that Cas9 expressing pigs may be used to induce desired genomic modifications to model human diseases or further evaluate in vivo gene therapy approaches.","1932-6203","PloS one","(17) e0279123",2022,"Jenny-Helena","Söllner","JH","Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut, Institute for Farm Animal Genetics, Neustadt am Rübenberge, Lower Saxony, Germany."

DNA samples from these cases were sequenced by next generation sequencing (NGS) using a selected gene panel. Results revealed that most gene mutations were not specific for EBV positive DLBCL. However, B2M (β2-microglobulin) mutations were significantly increased and HLA-I or HLA-II expression was decreased in these cases, which was related to patient's poor outcome. B2M mutations and deregulation of B2M expression were further confirmed by Sanger sequencing and immunohistochemistry. Reducing the infiltration of CD8+ T lymphocytes, related to decreased expression of HLA-I or HLA-II was found in these patients. These results suggest that the mutations of B2M could cause the disruption of the expression and functions of this important subunit of HLA, leading to decreased expression of HLA-I or HLA-II and subsequently to reduce T lymphocyte infiltration in tumor tissues. The consequence of this event lessens the recognition and elimination of EBV+ tumor cells by host immunity and paves the way for the host immune tolerance to EBV+ tumor cells by evading immune recognition and escaping the T lymphocyte killing.","1837-9664","Journal of Cancer","(13) 3615-3622",2022,"Miaoxia","He","M","Department of Pathology, Changhai Hospital, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, China 200433."

ICI therapies have been particularly successful in hypermutated cancers infiltrated with lymphocytes. However, resistance may appear in tumors evading the immune system through alternative mechanisms than the PD-1/PD-L1 or CTLA-4 pathways. A systematic pan-cancer literature search was conducted to examine the association between alternative immune evasion mechanisms via the antigen presentation machinery (APM) and resistance towards ICI treatments targeting PD-1 (pembrolizumab and nivolumab), PD-L1 (durvalumab, avelumab, and atezolizumab), and CTLA-4 (ipilimumab).

The objective of this study was to assess the utility of 24-hour composites as representative samples for measuring multiple microbiological targets in wastewater, and whether normalization of SARS-CoV-2 by endogenous targets can be used to decrease hour to hour variability at different watershed scales. Two sets of experiments were conducted, in tandem with the same wastewater, with samples collected at the building, cluster, and community sewershed scales. The first set of experiments focused on evaluating degradation of microbiological targets: SARS-CoV-2, Simian Immunodeficiency Virus (SIV) - a surrogate spiked into the wastewater, plus human waste indicators of Pepper Mild Mottle Virus (PMMoV), Beta-2 microglobulin (B2M), and fecal coliform bacteria (FC). The second focused on the variability of these targets from samples, collected each hour on the hour. Results show that SARS-CoV-2, PMMoV, and B2M were relatively stable, with minimal degradation over 24-h. SIV, which was spiked-in prior to analysis, degraded significantly and FC increased significantly over the course of 24 h, emphasizing the possibility for decay and growth within wastewater. Hour-to-hour variability of the source wastewater was large between each hour of sampling relative to the variability of the SARS-CoV-2 levels calculated between sewershed scales; thus, differences in SARS-CoV-2 hourly variability were not statistically significant between sewershed scales. Results further provided that the quantified representativeness of 24-h composite samples (i.e., statistical equivalency compared against hourly collected grabs) was dependent upon the molecular target measured. Overall, improvements made by normalization were minimal within this study. Degradation and multiplication for other targets should be evaluated when deciding upon whether to collect composite or grab samples in future studies.","1879-1026","The Science of the total environment","(867) 161423",2023,"Kristina M","Babler","KM","Department of Chemical, Environmental, and Materials Engineering, University of Miami, Coral Gables, FL 33146, USA."

Previous studies have demonstrated that features of the diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) TME can be associated with prognosis, but questions remain about the mechanisms underlying these TME features, and the interplay between tumor cells and the local TME. Therefore, we performed multispectral immunofluorescence (mIF) using two 6-color panels to interrogate the cellular proportions of T-cell subsets, macrophages, and natural killer cells in 57 cases of de novo DLBCL treated with R-CHOP chemotherapy. We found that very low CD3+ T-cell proportion and low CD4+PD1+ and CD8+PD1+ T cells have poor survival compared to those with a high T-cell proportion. Also, cases with concurrently low TIM3 and PD1 have a poor prognosis. This poor prognosis with low T-cell proportion was validated using immune deconvolution of gene expression profiling data from 351 cases of DLBCL and an additional cohort of 53 cases of DLBCL using routine immunohistochemistry. In addition, cases with loss of B2M, HLA I and/or HLA II protein expression on the tumor cells also had a low T-cell proportion, providing evidence that lack of these proteins allows for immune evasion. Overall, our results show that patients with DLBCL with a low T-cell proportion in the TME have a poor survival when treated with R-CHOP and exhibit mechanisms of immune escape.","1592-8721","Haematologica","(108) 2167-2177",2023,"Joo Y","Song","JY","Department of Pathology, City of Hope, Duarte, CA. josong@coh.org."

Beta-2-microglobulin (B2M) is synthesized from all nucleated cells and constitutes a major histocompatibility complex class I antigen. In human medicine, high concentrations of these two factors have been found to be related to prognosis in aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. In this pilot study, we aimed to assess the correlation between the serum concentration of IL-2R and B2M and the diagnosis and prognosis of canine lymphoma. This study included 8 healthy dogs and 17 dogs with lymphoma. To measure the serum concentration of IL-2R and B2M, a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used. In dogs with lymphoma, IL-2R concentrations were significantly high at the time of diagnosis, but B2M concentrations were not. In relapsed dogs, both IL-2R and B2M concentrations were significantly higher than those in the control and chemotherapy response groups. When the serum concentrations of IL-2R and B2M during chemotherapy were monitored in four relapsed dogs, B2M levels were more closely related with relapse. This study demonstrated that serum IL-2R and B2M concentration can be a diagnostic or prognostic tool for canine lymphoma. Monitoring of serum B2M concentration seems to be useful for predicting relapse.","1476-5829","Veterinary and comparative oncology","(21) 184-190",2023,"Jae-Hyeon","Im","JH","Laboratory of Veterinary Internal Medicine, Department of Veterinary Clinical Science, College of Veterinary Medicine, Seoul National University, Seoul, Republic of Korea."
36681183,"Explorations of CRISPR/Cas9 for improving the long-term efficacy of universal CAR-T cells in tumor immunotherapy.","Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T therapy has shown remarkable success in discovering novel CAR-T cell products for treating malignancies. Despite of successful results from clinical trials, CAR-T cell therapy is ineffective for long-term disease progression. Numerous challenges of CAR-T cell immunotherapy such as cell dysfunction, cytokine-related toxicities, TGF-β resistance, GvHD risks, antigen escape, restricted trafficking, and tumor cell infiltration still exist that hamper the safety and efficacy of CAR-T cells for malignancies. The accumulated data revealed that these challenges could be overcome with the advanced CRISPR genome editing technology, which is the most promising tool to knockout TRAC and HLA genes, inhibiting the effects of dominant negative receptors (PD-1, TGF-β, and B2M), lowering the risks of cytokine release syndrome (CRS), and regulating CAR-T cell function in the tumor microenvironment (TME). CRISPR technology employs DSB-free genome editing methods that robustly allow efficient and controllable genetic modification. The present review explored the innovative aspects of CRISPR/Cas9 technology for developing next-generation/universal allogeneic CAR-T cells. The present manuscript addressed the ongoing status of clinical trials of CRISPR/Cas9-engineered CAR-T cells against cancer and pointed out the off-target effects associated with CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing.

To delineate prevalence and associations of B2M mutations in MSI-H/dMMR cancers, we investigated the mutational profile of B2M and clinical and pathological features in gastric cancer (GC), colorectal cancer (CRC), and endometrial cancer (EC) with a high incidence of microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H)/dMMR. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor tissues along with matched normal tissues were collected from 108 MSI/dMMR patients with GC, CRC, and EC. Genomic profiling of tissue and blood samples were assessed next-generation sequencing (NGS). Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was used to examine the presence or absence of B2M protein. Alternations in the exonic microsatellite regions of B2M were observed at various but high frequencies (57.5% in CRC, 23.9% in GC, and 13.6% in EC) and in different forms. NGS assay revealed that genes involved in chromatin regulation, the PI3K pathway, the WNT pathway, and mismatch repair were extensively altered in the MSI-H cohort. Signature 6 and 26, 2 of 4 mutational signatures associated with defective DNA mismatch repair, featured with high numbers of small insertion/deletions (INDEL) dominated in all 3 types of cancer.

36868208,"β2-microglobulin functions as an endogenous NMDAR antagonist to impair synaptic function.","Down syndrome (DS) is a neurological disorder with multiple immune-related symptoms; however, crosstalk between the CNS and peripheral immune system remains unexplored. Using parabiosis and plasma infusion, we found that blood-borne factors drive synaptic deficits in DS. Proteomic analysis revealed elevation of β2-microglobulin (B2M), a major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) component, in human DS plasma. Systemic administration of B2M in wild-type mice led to synaptic and memory defects similar to those observed in DS mice. Moreover, genetic ablation of B2m or systemic administration of an anti-B2M antibody counteracts synaptic impairments in DS mice. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that B2M antagonizes NMDA receptor (NMDAR) function through interactions with the GluN1-S2 loop; blocking B2M-NMDAR interactions using competitive peptides restores NMDAR-dependent synaptic function. Our findings identify B2M as an endogenous NMDAR antagonist and reveal a pathophysiological role for circulating B2M in NMDAR dysfunction in DS and related cognitive disorders.","1097-4172","Cell","(186) 1026-1038.e20",2023,"Yue","Gao","Y","State Key Laboratory of Cellular Stress Biology, Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory of Neurodegenerative Disease and Aging Research, Institute of Neuroscience, Department of Neurology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Xiamen University, School of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine and Life Sciences, Xiamen University, Xiamen, Fujian 361005, China; Shenzhen Research Institute of Xiamen University, Shenzhen, Guangdong 518057, China."
36898366,"Primary Mediastinal B-Cell Lymphoma in Children and Young Adults.","Primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL) is a rare but aggressive mature B-cell lymphoma that arises from thymic B cells and most commonly affects adolescents and young adults. PMBCL is now recognized by the WHO as a distinct entity from diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), not otherwise specified, with a unique clinical presentation and distinct morphologic features and molecular alterations. Similar to classic Hodgkin lymphoma, PMBCL tumors are characterized by alterations in the nuclear factor-κB and JAK/STAT pathways. These tumors also exhibit an immune evasion phenotype marked by upregulation of PD-L1 and loss of B2M. Historic data indicates that outcomes for pediatric patients with PMBCL are inferior compared with pediatric patients with DLBCL treated on the same protocols, and there is no current standard approach to initial treatment. Common regimens used for children with PMBCL include multiagent chemotherapy regimens designed for Burkitt lymphoma, such as Lymphomes Malins B (LMB)-based or Berlin-Frankfurt-Münster (BFM)-based chemotherapy ± rituximab. Based on initial data in adults showing excellent outcomes with the use of DA-EPOCH-R regimens, these regimens have also been adopted in pediatrics, although with mixed results. Novel agents are currently being studied in PMBCL with the goal of improving outcomes and reducing reliance on radiation and/or high-dose chemotherapy. Immune checkpoint blockade with PD-1 inhibition is of particular interest given the upregulation of PD-L1 in PMBCL and the known efficacy of these agents in the relapsed setting. Future efforts in PMBCL will also seek to determine the role of FDG-PET in evaluating response to therapy and the role of biomarkers in risk stratification.","1540-1413","Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network : JNCCN","(21) 323-330",2023,"Christopher J","Forlenza","CJ","1Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York."

Current evidence on the relationship between beta-2-microglobulin (B2M) and mortality in the general and non-chronic kidney disease (CKD) population are limited and controversial. Data from the nutrition and health examination survey database and the nutrition and health examination survey linked mortality file were used. In total, 10,388 adults who had complete data for B2M were included. Weighted multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models and regression splines were employed to evaluate the relationship between B2M with mortality. Moreover, subgroup and sensitivity analyses were performed. During a median follow up of 17.9 years (interquartile range 15.2-18.7), 2780 people died, 902 (32%) from cardiovascular disease. Restricted cubic splines showed that B2M is J-shaped nonlinear positively associated with all-cause mortality and cardiovascular disease mortality in the non-CKD and general population. Based on the multivariable adjustment model, the adjusted hazard ratios comparing the highest versus lowest quartile of the distribution of B2M were 2.50 (95% confidence interval: 1.90, 3.28) for all-cause mortality in the general population, 2.58 (95% confidence interval: 1.52, 4.37) for cardiovascular disease mortality in the general population, 2.58 (1.91, 3.49) for all-cause mortality in the non-CKD population and 2.62 (1.52, 4.53) for cardiovascular disease mortality in the non-CKD population.

We studied 41 patients with SMZL that eventually underwent large B-cell lymphoma transformation. Tumor material was obtained either only at diagnosis (9 patients), at diagnosis and transformation (18 patients), and only at transformation (14 patients). Samples were categorized in 2 groups: (1) at diagnosis (SMZL, n = 27 samples), and (2) at transformation (SMZL-T, n = 32 samples). Using copy number arrays and a next-generation sequencing custom panel, we identified that the main genomic alterations in SMZL-T involved TNFAIP3, KMT2D, TP53, ARID1A, KLF2, 1q gains, and losses of 9p21.3 (CDKN2A/B) and 7q31-q32. Compared with SMZL, SMZL-T had higher genomic complexity, and higher incidence of TNFAIP3 and TP53 alterations, 9p21.3 (CDKN2A/B) losses, and 6p gains. SMZL and SMZL-T clones arose by divergent evolution from a common altered precursor cell that acquired different genetic alterations in virtually all evaluable cases (92%, 12 of 13 cases). Using whole-genome sequencing of diagnostic and transformation samples in 1 patient, we observed that the SMZL-T sample carried more genomic aberrations than the diagnostic sample, identified a translocation t(14;19)(q32;q13) present in both samples, and detected a focal B2M deletion due to chromothripsis acquired at transformation. Survival analysis showed that KLF2 mutations, complex karyotype, and International Prognostic Index score at transformation were predictive of a shorter survival from transformation (P = .001; P = .042; and P = .007; respectively). In summary, SMZL-T are characterized by higher genomic complexity than SMZL, and characteristic genomic alterations that could represent key players in the transformation event.","2473-9537","Blood advances","(7) 3695-3709",2023,"Marta","Grau","M","Molecular Pathology of Lymphoid Neoplasms, Fundació Clínic per a la Recerca Biomèdica - Institut d'Investigacions Biomèdiques August Pi i Sunyer, Barcelona, Spain."

The pathophysiology is not fully understood. Since RGCs have a high energy demand, suboptimal mitochondrial function may put the survival of these neurons at risk. In the present study, we explored whether mtDNA copy number or mtDNA deletions could reveal a mitochondrial component in POAG pathophysiology. Buffy coat DNA was isolated from EDTA blood of age- and sex-matched study groups, namely POAG patients with high intraocular pressure (IOP) at diagnosis (high tension glaucoma: HTG; n = 97), normal tension glaucoma patients (NTG, n = 37), ocular hypertensive controls (n = 9), and cataract controls (without glaucoma; n = 32), all without remarkable comorbidities. The number of mtDNA copies was assessed through qPCR quantification of the mitochondrial D-loop and nuclear B2M gene. Presence of the common 4977 base pair mtDNA deletion was assessed by a highly sensitive breakpoint PCR. Analysis showed that HTG patients had a lower number of mtDNA copies per nuclear DNA than NTG patients (p-value <0.01, Dunn test) and controls (p-value <0.001, Dunn test). The common 4977 base pair mtDNA deletion was not detected in any of the participants. A lower mtDNA copy number in blood of HTG patients suggests a role for a genetically defined, deficient mtDNA replication in the pathology of HTG. This may cause a low number of mtDNA copies in RGCs, which together with aging and high IOP, may lead to mitochondrial dysfunction, and contribute to glaucoma pathology.","1096-0007","Experimental eye research","(232) 109500",2023,"Antoni","Vallbona-Garcia","A","University Eye Clinic Maastricht, Maastricht University Medical Center+, Maastricht, the Netherlands; Department of Toxicogenomics, Maastricht University, Maastricht, the Netherlands; School for Mental Health and Neuroscience, Maastricht University, Maastricht, the Netherlands.

FL subsets by grade, stage, watch-and-wait, or POD24 status did not differ by mutation burden, whereas mutation burden was significantly higher in relapsed/refractory (rel/ref) FL and t-FL than in newly diagnosed (dx) FL. Nonetheless, mutation burden in dx FL was not associated with frontline progression-free survival (PFS). CREBBP was the only gene more commonly mutated in FL than in t-FL yet mutated CREBBP was associated with shorter frontline PFS in FL.

B2M is naturally shed from cell surfaces into the plasma, followed by renal excretion. In patients with impaired renal function, B2M will accumulate in organs and tissues leading to significantly reduced life expectancy and quality of life. While current hemodialysis methods have been successful in managing electrolyte as well as small and large molecule disturbances arising in chronic renal failure, they have shown only modest success in managing plasma levels of B2M and similar sized proteins, while sparing important proteins such as albumin. We describe a systematic protein design effort aimed at adding the ability to selectively remove specific, undesired waste proteins such as B2M from the plasma of chronic renal failure patients. A novel nanoparticle built using a tetrahedral protein assembly as a scaffold that presents 12 copies of a B2M-binding nanobody is described. The designed nanoparticle binds specifically to B2M through protein-protein interactions with nanomolar binding affinity (~4.2 nM). Notably, binding to the nanoparticle increases the effective size of B2M by over 50-fold, offering a potential selective avenue for separation based on size. We present data to support the potential utility of such a nanoparticle for removing B2M from plasma by either size-based filtration or by polyvalent binding to a stationary matrix under blood flow conditions. Such applications could address current shortcomings in the management of problematic mid-sized proteins in chronic renal failure patients.","2218-273X","Biomolecules","1122",2023,"Justin E","Miller","JE","Molecular Biology Institute, University of California, Los Angeles, CA 90095, USA."

RCC is characterized by high immune infiltration and thus recommended for immunotherapeutic interventions at an advanced stage in clinical guidelines. Nevertheless, limited benefits of immunotherapy have prompted investigations into underlying mechanisms, leading to the proposal of metabolic dysregulation-induced immunoevasion as a crucial contributor. In this study, a significant decrease is found in the abundance of alpha-ketoglutarate (αKG), a crucial intermediate metabolite in the TCA cycle, which is correlated with higher grades and a worse prognosis in clinical RCC samples. Elevated levels of αKG promote major histocompatibility complex-I (MHC-I) antigen processing and presentation, as well as the expression of β2-microglobulin (B2M). While αKG modulates broad-spectrum demethylation activities of histone, the transcriptional upregulation of B2M is dependent on the demethylation of H3K4me1 in its promoter region. Furthermore, the combination of αKG supplementation and PD-1 blockade leads to improved therapeutic efficacy and prolongs survival in murine models when compared to monotherapy. Overall, the findings elucidate the mechanisms of immune evasion in anti-tumor immunotherapies and suggest a potential combinatorial treatment strategy in RCC.","2198-3844","Advanced science (Weinheim, Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany)","(10) e2301975",2023,"Le","Li","L","Department of Urology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430030, China."

Each model was then used to estimate the age of bloodstains from two independent test sets each laboratory had prepared. The elastic net model built on both datasets with training samples up to 320 days old displayed the best prediction performance across all test samples (MAD=18.9 days). There was a substantial difference in the prediction performance for the two laboratories: Restricting TsD to up to 100 days for test data, one laboratory obtained an MAD of 2.0 days when trained on its own data, whereas the other laboratory obtained an MAD of 15 days.","1872-6283","Forensic science international","(350) 111785",2023,"Nadescha Viviane","Hänggi","NV","Zurich Institute of Forensic Medicine, University of Zurich, Switzerland."

We searched for suitable RGs for qPCR to determine the response to radiotherapy in colorectal cancer (CRC) cell lines, organoids, and patient-derived tissues. Ten CRC cell lines (Caco-2, COLO 205, DLD-1, HCT116, HCT-15, HT-29, RKO, SW1116, SW480, and SW620) and organoids were selected and irradiated with 2, 10 or 21 grays (Gy) based on the previous related studies conducted over the last decade. The expression stability of 14 housekeeping genes (HKGs; ACTB, B2M, G6PD, GAPDH, GUSB, HMBS, HPRT1, IPO8, PGK1, PPIA, TBP, TFRC, UBC, and YWHAZ) after irradiation was evaluated using RefFinder using raw quantification cycle (Cq) values obtained from samples before and after irradiation. The expression stability of HKGs were also evaluated for paired fresh frozen tissues or formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded samples obtained from CRC patients before and after chemoradiotherapy. The expression of YWHAZ and TBP encoding 14-3-3-zeta protein and TATA-binding protein were more stable than the other 12 HKGs in CRC cell lines, organoids, and patient-derived tissues after irradiation. The findings suggest that YWHAZ and TBP are potential RG candidates for normalizing qPCR results in CRC radiotherapy experiments.","2045-2322","Scientific reports","(13) 12902",2023,"Shin","Kim","S","Department of Immunology, Keimyung University School of Medicine, Daegu, Republic of Korea."

37606492,"How I Manage Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia.","Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), is a hematologic malignancy characterized by the uncontrolled proliferation of mature B lymphocytes. CLL is the most prevalent leukemia in Western countries. Its presentation can range from asymptomatic with the incidental finding of absolute lymphocytosis on a routine blood test, to symptomatic disease requiring immediate intervention. Prognosis of the disease is defined by the presence or absence of specific mutations such as TP53, chromosomal abnormalities such as del(17p), a type of IGHV mutational status, and elevation of B2M and LDH. Treatment of CLL in the United States and Europe has evolved over the recent years thanks to the development of targeted therapies. The standard of care has shifted from traditional chemoimmunotherapy approaches to targeted therapies including Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitors (BTKis) and BCL2 inhibitors, administered either as monotherapy or in combination with CD20 monoclonal antibodies. Several clinical trials have also recently evaluated combinations of BTKi and venetoclax and showed the combination to be well tolerated and able to induce deep remissions. Targeted therapies have a good safety profile overall; however, they also have unique toxicities that are important to recognize. Diarrhea, fatigue, arthralgia, infections, cytopenias, bleeding, and cardiovascular toxicities (including atrial fibrillation, ventricular arrhythmias, and hypertension) are the adverse events (AEs) commonly associated with BTKis. Initiation of therapy with venetoclax requires close monitoring because of the risk for tumor lysis syndrome associated with this agent, particularly in patients with a high disease burden. Development of newer target therapies is ongoing and the therapeutic landscape in CLL is expanding rapidly.","2038-8322","Hematology reports","(15) 454-464",2023,"Patrice","Nasnas","P","Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA."
37626956,"Kidney Damage in Long COVID: Studies in Experimental Mice.","Signs and symptoms involving multiple organ systems which persist for weeks or months to years after the initial SARS-CoV-2 infection (also known as PASC or long COVID) are common complications of individuals with COVID-19. We recently reported pathophysiological changes in various organs post-acute infection of mice with mouse hepatitis virus-1 (MHV-1, a coronavirus) (7 days) and after long-term post-infection (12 months). One of the organs severely affected in this animal model is the kidney, which correlated well with human studies showing kidney injury post-SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our long-term post-infection pathological observation in kidneys includes the development of edema and inflammation of the renal parenchyma, severe acute tubular necrosis, and infiltration of macrophages and lymphocytes, in addition to changes observed in both acute and long-term post-infection, which include tubular epithelial cell degenerative changes, peritubular vessel congestion, proximal and distal tubular necrosis, hemorrhage in the interstitial tissue, and vacuolation of renal tubules. These findings strongly suggest the possible development of renal fibrosis, in particular in the long-term post-infection. Accordingly, we investigated whether the signaling system that is known to initiate the above-mentioned changes in kidneys in other conditions is also activated in long-term post-MHV-1 infection. We found increased TGF-β1, FGF23, NGAL, IL-18, HIF1-α, TLR2, YKL-40, and B2M mRNA levels in long-term post-MHV-1 infection, but not EGFR, TNFR1, BCL3, and WFDC2. However, only neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) increased in acute infection (7 days). Immunoblot studies showed an elevation in protein levels of HIF1-α, TLR-2, and EGFR in long-term post-MHV-1 infection, while KIM-1 and MMP-7 protein levels are increased in acute infection. Treatment with a synthetic peptide, SPIKENET (SPK), which inhibits spike protein binding, reduced NGAL mRNA in acute infection, and decreased TGF-β1, BCL3 mRNA, EGFR, HIF1-α, and TLR-2 protein levels long-term post-MHV-1 infection. These findings suggest that fibrotic events may initiate early in SARS-CoV-2 infection, leading to pronounced kidney fibrosis in long COVID.

This study aimed to find core genes and their potential roles in HIE with the help of single-cell sequencing (SCS) technology and genes network construction. We collected and screened an HIE genes data set from the Pubmed database to analyze differential expression, and the differential values of genes were ≥3 or ≤-3 in gene expression. We constructed a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network by the string, which was also verified by Cytoscape 3.8.2. Functional enrichment analysis was performed to determine the characteristics and pathways of the core genes. We examined two meaningful papers and integrated all genes by SCS, which were classified into 12,093 genes without duplicates, 217 shared genes, and 11,876 distinct genes. Among 217 genes, the signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) family was the most targeted gene in the PPI network. Moreover, Gene Ontology and Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genome analysis showed that the process in response to virus and the JAK-STAT signaling pathway play significant roles in HIE. We also found that 54 screened genes were highly expressed, while three genes (B2M, VIM, and MRPS30) were different in the heat map and differential genes expression exhibition. VIM, as an essential portion of the brain's cytoskeleton, is closely linked to STAT and neurologic development. From the findings of SCS and bioinformatics predictive analytics model, our outcomes provided a better understanding of the roles of STAT, the JAK-STAT signaling pathway, and VIM, which can pave an alternative avenue for further studies on HIE progression.","2769-2795","Ibrain","(8) 78-92",2022,"Hong-Su","Zhou","HS","Department of Laboratory Zoology Kunming Medical University Kunming Yunnan China."

Its loss results in acquired resistance to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapies. However, there have been well-documented cases of B2M-inactivated tumors responding to ICB, justifying investigation of how an antitumor immune response can be generated to tumors without surface MHC class I. We knocked out B2M in three murine models with varying baseline MHC class I expression and sensitivity to anti-programmed death receptor (PD-1) therapy and analyzed the immune responses. MC38 and YUMMER2.1 without B2M responded to anti-PD-1 alone or with an IL2 agonist, and this was mediated by CD4+ T cells and natural killer (NK) cells. The more aggressive B16 without B2M expression only partially responded to the IL2 agonist, and this was dependent on NK cells. When analyzing nearly 300 pretreatment biopsies from patients with melanoma receiving PD-1 blockade-based therapies, we found infrequent B2M mutations or homozygous loss but more frequent LOH or copy-number gains. B2M LOH was enriched in biopsies from patients without response to therapy, and these biopsies were more frequently infiltrated by activated NK cells. We conclude that in the absence of B2M, activation of CD4+ T cells and NK cells can mediate responses to murine models of PD-1 blockade therapy. In addition, in human melanoma, the intratumoral presence of activated NK cells upon partial B2M loss likely selects against tumor escape through low surface MHC class I expression.","2326-6074","Cancer immunology research","(11) 1642-1655",2023,"Davis Y","Torrejon","DY","Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology-Oncology, University of California Los Angeles (UCLA), Los Angeles, California."

37822610,"Don't eat me/eat me signals as a novel strategy in cancer immunotherapy.","Cancer stands as one of the prominent global causes of death, with its incidence burden continuously increasing, leading to a substantial rise in mortality rates. Cancer treatment has seen the development of various strategies, each carrying its drawbacks that can negatively impact the quality of life for cancer patients. The challenge remains significant within the medical field to establish a definitive cancer treatment that minimizes complications and limitations. In the forthcoming years, exploring new strategies to surmount the failures in cancer treatment appears to be an unavoidable pursuit. Among these strategies, immunology-based ones hold substantial promise in combatting cancer and immune-related disorders. A particular subset of this approach identifies ""eat me"" and ""Don't eat me"" signals in cancer cells, contrasting them with their counterparts in non-cancerous cells. This distinction could potentially mark a significant breakthrough in treating diverse cancers. By delving into signal transduction and engineering novel technologies that utilize distinct ""eat me"" and ""Don't eat me"" signals, a valuable avenue may emerge for advancing cancer treatment methodologies. Macrophages, functioning as vital components of the immune system, regulate metabolic equilibrium, manage inflammatory disorders, oversee fibrosis, and aid in the repair of injuries. However, in the context of tumor cells, the overexpression of ""Don't eat me"" signals like CD47, PD-L1, and beta-2 microglobulin (B2M), an anti-phagocytic subunit of the primary histocompatibility complex class I, enables these cells to evade macrophages and proliferate uncontrollably. Conversely, the presentation of an ""eat me"" signal, such as Phosphatidylserine (PS), along with alterations in charge and glycosylation patterns on the cellular surface, modifications in intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) epitopes, and the exposure of Calreticulin and PS on the outer layer of the plasma membrane represent universally observed changes on the surface of apoptotic cells, preventing phagocytosis from causing harm to adjacent non-tumoral cells. The current review provides insight into how signaling pathways and immune cells either stimulate or obstruct these signals, aiming to address challenges that may arise in future immunotherapy research. A potential solution lies in combination therapies targeting the ""eat me"" and ""Don't eat me"" signals in conjunction with other targeted therapeutic approaches. This innovative strategy holds promise as a novel avenue for the future treatment of cancer.","2405-8440","Heliyon","(9) e20507",2023,"Amirreza","Khalaji","A","Immunology Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran."

To address immune rejection, we investigated the impact of genetically modifying human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I in kidney organoids prior to transplantation. By using CRISPR-Cas9, we successfully knocked out beta-2-microglobulin (B2M), resulting in iPSCs devoid of HLA class I surface expression. In vitro, the B2M knockout protected kidney organoids derived from these iPSCs against T-cell rejection. To assess in vivo protection, unmodified (control) and B2M-/- kidney organoids were transplanted into humanized mice engrafted with human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Successful engraftment of human PBMCs was confirmed, and after 4 weeks, we observed no discernible difference in the infiltration rate, proliferation, or cytotoxicity of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells between control and B2M-/- organoids. Both groups of organoids showed compromised tissue integrity, displaying tubulitis and loss of tubule integrity. Notably, while B2M-/- organoids failed to express HLA class I on their cell surface, there was preexisting expression of HLA class II in both control and B2M-/- organoids transplanted into mice with human PBMCs. HLA class II expression was not limited to antigen-presenting cells but also evident in epithelial cells of the kidney organoid, posing an additional immunological challenge to its transplantation. Consequently, we conclude that B2M knockout alone is insufficient to protect iPSC-derived kidney organoids from T-cell-mediated immune rejection. Additionally, our findings suggest that modulating HLA class II signaling will be necessary to prevent rejection following transplantation.","2157-6580","Stem cells translational medicine","szad069",2023,"Lonneke H","Gaykema","LH","Department of Internal Medicine (Nephrology) & Einthoven Laboratory of Vascular and Regenerative Medicine, Leiden University Medical Center (LUMC), 2333 ZA Leiden, The Netherlands."

In the study, eight candidate reference genes (GAPDH, ACTB, 18S, PPIA, B2M, SDHA, GUSB, and YWHAZ) were selected for RT-qPCR to detect their expression in NCM460, HT29, HCT116, SW480, SW620, DLD-1, LOVO and RKO cell lines. The stability of reference genes and the optimal panel were evaluated by geNorm, NormFinder, and BestKeeper software. As results, the expression levels of candidate reference genes differed in the colonic epithelial cell lines, and the number of optimal panel of reference genes is two. B2M and YWHAZ were the two most stable reference genes for NCM460, HCT116, SW620, LOVO, and RKO cell lines, while only one of B2M and YWHAZ was most stable in HT29 and SW480 cells.

Herein, we aimed to identify potential candidate proteins associated with low bone mineral density (BMD) in postmenopausal women from the Mexican population. Serum samples from postmenopausal women (40 with normal BMD, 40 with osteopenia (OS), and 20 with osteoporosis (OP)) were analyzed by label-free LC-MS/MS quantitative proteomics. Proteome profiling revealed significant differences between the OS and OP groups compared to individuals with normal BMD. A quantitative comparison of proteins between groups indicated 454 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs).

Newly identified biomarkers might provide insights into the diagnosis and treatment of HF with TCM syndrome differentiation.","1535-3907","Journal of proteome research","10.1021/acs.jproteome.3c00537",2023,"Taohua","Lan","T","State Key Laboratory of Dampness Syndrome of Chinese Medicine, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine, Guangzhou 510020, China."
38053293,"Highly efficient genome editing via CRISPR-Cas9 ribonucleoprotein (RNP) delivery in mesenchymal stem cells.","The CRISPR-Cas9 system has significantly advanced regenerative medicine research by enabling genome editing in stem cells. Due to their desirable properties, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have recently emerged as highly promising therapeutic agents, which properties include differentiation abilit and cytokine production. While CRISPR-Cas9 technology is applied to develop MSC-based therapeutics, MSCs exhibit inefficient genome editing, and susceptibility to plasmid DNA. In this study, we compared and optimized plasmid DNA and RNP approaches for efficient genome engineering in MSCs. The RNP-mediated approach enabled genome editing with high indel frequency and low cytotoxicity in MSCs. By utilizing Cas9 RNPs, we successfully generated B2M-knockout MSCs, which reduced T-cell differentiation, and improved MSC survival. Furthermore, this approach enhanced the immunomodulatory effect of IFN-r priming. These findings indicate that the RNP-mediated engineering of MSC genomes can achieve high efficiency, and engineered MSCs offer potential as a promising therapeutic strategy.","1976-670X","BMB reports","5981",2023,"A Reum","Han","AR",""
38092161,"Identification and validation of stable reference genes for expression profiling of target genes in diverse ovine tissues.","Quantitative PCR (qPCR) is a widely-used technique for quantifying the expression of target genes across various tissues, as well as under different pathological and physiological conditions. One of the challenges associated with this method is the need to identify optimal reference genes (RGs) that maintain consistent expression levels under diverse experimental settings, thereby ensuring accurate biological interpretation. In this study, we conducted a thorough analysis of 18 candidate RGs (ACTB, BACH1, B2M, GAPDH, HMBS, HPRT1, PGK1, PPIA, PPIB, RPLP0, RPL19, RPS9, RPS15, RPS28, SDHA, TBP, UXT, and YWHAZ) across 10 ovine tissues (muscle, skin, kidney, liver, intestine, rumen, lung, testis, heart, and spleen) obtained from five individual sheep. We aimed to identify genes with stable expression across these tissues. A literature-based survey helped us shortlist candidate genes representing various functional classes from multiple livestock species. We employed four algorithms: geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, and Delta Ct (ΔCt), to rank these genes based on their stability. A consistent trend in the rankings was observed across these different algorithms. RefFinder was then used for a comprehensive ranking, integrating the outputs from the various methods. ACTB, PPIB, BACH1, and B2M emerged as the most stable RGs, while RPS9, RPS15, and PGK1 displayed variable expression. We validated our findings through qPCR analysis of four target genes (ACTN2, CRYAB, DLK1, and TRIM54) in the skin samples from two different sheep breeds. Based on these results, we recommend ACTB, PPIB, BACH1, and B2M as reliable internal control genes for qPCR experiments involving diverse ovine tissues.","1879-0038","Gene","S0378-1119(23)00908-3",2023,"Mahanthi","Vasu","M","ICAR-National Bureau of Animal Genetic Resources, Karnal; ICAR-National Dairy Research Institute, Karnal."
